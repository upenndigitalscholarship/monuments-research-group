<h1>About</h1>
<p>Begun at the University of Pennsylvania in 2022, this project set out to build a database of responses to Confederate commemoration from the Black press. The database eventually grew to include over 2000 articles from over 150 Black newspapers dating as far back as 1869. Our student researchers wrote over 30 articles offering windows into the stories told by this collection. The <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a> and the <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/rdds">Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship</a> built this website.</p>
<p>Generous funding and support were provided by a number of sources, including the <a href="https://curf.upenn.edu/">Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships</a>, the <a href="https://cseri.sas.upenn.edu/">Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration</a>, and the <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a>.</p>
<p>This project documents racism and oppression and contains disturbing images, language, and references to historical events.</p>

<p>_Many of the articles presented Confederate monument controversy as only affecting Blacks and as a symbolic issue alone. However, the erection of these Confederate monuments was spurred by institutional racism, which affects everyone in the United States regardless of race. Additionally, the problem is not just the monuments’ existence but that people wanted them up in the first place and why. Further investigation into how language places people within this issue—or removes them from it—could shed light on why the Confederate monument controvery has been drawn out for over a century. _- Olivia Haynie</p>

<p><em>Confederate monuments are not just symbols of hatred and white supremacy, they are perpetuators of it. Lynchings, cross burnings, and KKK rituals are rudimentary parts of the existence of Confederate monuments, where they were not passive symbols but active sites promoting white supremacy. Beyond individual instances of racism, their collective existence is a monument to the spirit of white supremacy and the systemic racism that continues to grip this country and its history. As white people debated whether the monuments reflected history or treason, Black people called out their true nature.</em> - Justin Seward</p>
