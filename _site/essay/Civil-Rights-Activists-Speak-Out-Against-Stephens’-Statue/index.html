  <h1>"Cold Marble Can Proclaim Its Cause"</h1> 
  <h4> The Alexander Stephens Statue in the Capitol</h4>
  

<br>
  <p><i></i></p> 
  
  <p>In April 1926, the <em>New York Amsterdam News</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> and the <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> simultaneously printed a letter authored by Neval Thomas, a civil rights activist then serving as president of the Washington, D.C. branch of the NAACP.</p>
<p>Thomas’s letter criticized plans to erect a statue to Alexander Stephens, vice-president of the CSA, in the National Statuary Hall of the Capitol Building. The letter was addressed to the Architect of the Capitol, arguing that Stephens “wears the stain of helping to found the only government in the history of the world whose sole purpose was the perpetuation of slavery.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> Thomas connected the Stephens monument to specific injustices in the long struggle against racism, proclaiming that Stephens</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gave all of his genius to that spirit that murdered Lovejoy, assaulted<br>
Sumner, dragged Garrison through the streets of Boston, placed a price<br>
upon the head of Frederick Douglass and brought infinite sorrow and<br>
suffering to the millions of noble men and women in black.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas also drew a clear line between the myth of the Lost Cause and the evocative power of monuments, writing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The urge for the admission of these two statues springs from the unrepentant spirit that wants the union to admit that the South was right in seeking to wrong the Union. It knows that cold marble can proclaim its cause, especially when it is placed in the very center and heart of government.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The federal government ignored these arguments, and a statue of Stephens—a gift from the state of Georgia—was placed in Statuary Hall in 1927.</p>
<p>After the statue was installed, another nationally renowned civil rights leader, Mary Church Terrell, wrote an op-ed for the <em>New Journal and Guide</em> condemning the statue. She noted that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In no other country in the wide world would such a scene be possible as was witnessed in the Capitol a few days ago, when the statue of a man who had tried to destroy his government was received with gratitude and praise by one of its highest representatives!<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The representative Terrell referred to was then-vice-president Charles Dawes, who gave a speech at the statue’s dedication. Terrell warned that this warm “attitude toward a traitor” would teach American youth that the “effort to wreck and ruin the government under which one lives” is worthy of commemoration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Georgia, Terrell argued, had “added insult to injury” through the act of “giving to the Nation’s Hall of Fame the statue of a man who helped her try to cut the country in two.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
