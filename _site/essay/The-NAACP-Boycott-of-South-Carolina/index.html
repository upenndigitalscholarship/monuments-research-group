  <h1>"Push America Back from the Brink of Senseless Tribalism"</h1> 
  <h4> The NAACP Response to the Confederate Battle Flag at the South Carolina Capitol</h4>
  

<br>
  <p><i></i></p> 
  
  <p>In July 1999, the National Convention of the NAACP voted in favor of a tourism boycott of <a href="https://falseimage.pennds.org/essay/Removal-of-the-Confederate-Flag-from-the-S">South Carolina</a>. They were responding to the state’s continued display of the <a href="https://falseimage.pennds.org/essay/Stars-and-Bars-vs-Stars-and-Stripes">Confederate Battle Flag</a> on the dome of their capitol building.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> The boycott was proposed by the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> At the time, South Carolina was the only state to fly the Confederate flag itself at its capitol, although Georgia and Mississippi had incorporated parts of it into their own state flags.<a href="Hettena," title="NAACP Board Votes to Boycott South Carolina,">^3</a></p>
<p>The flag hadn’t been there for long. It was originally raised above the South Carolina Capitol in 1961, purportedly to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the Civil War, and was then left in place. Several failed attempts to bring it down had been made since this initial gesture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even though the resolution to boycott could not be officially ratified until the NAACP’s October meeting, the effects of the proposal came almost immediately. The boycott made national headlines and the actions of the NAACP and the effort was well-documented by the Associated Press (AP), whose reports were often reprinted in Black newspapers. Some Black publications, such as the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> and <em>Atlanta Daily World</em>, also undertook original coverage of the boycott.</p>
<p>Following the NAACP convention, the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> reported, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) canceled its convention in Charleston, S.C. The national president of the SCLC, Martin Luther King, III, stated “Many people try to justify the display of the Confederate flag by saying it is a symbol of Southern heritage. But in reality, the flag began to be displayed conspicuously as a symbol of resistance to the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> He went on to “urge every organization and corporation who loves justice to join this effort to push America back from the brink of senseless tribalism.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The boycott also received the support of civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> By early August, NAACP leadership was already coming up with ways to specifically target companies who supported pro-flag lawmakers. According to a report by the Associated Press, the group collected the financial disclosure forms of fourteen senators and seven House members, most of whom supported keeping the Confederate flag above the capitol dome. The forms listed political contributions, income, and business connections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In mid-October, the tourism boycott was officially ratified, mobilizing “all [NAACP] chapters and members to not visit or spend dollars in South Carolina until the flag is removed,” according to NAACP spokeswoman Sheila Douglas.<a href="Hettena," title="NAACP Board Votes to Boycott South Carolina,">^9</a> Associated Press reports quantified the impact of the boycott: an AP report reprinted in both the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> and <em>Atlanta Daily World</em> stated that following ratification, several groups from across the country canceled meetings and events originally planned to be hosted in South Carolina. This included the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, which had planned to bring 7,000 people to Columbia for a four-day meeting. That event alone, the article stated, would have contributed an estimated $500,000 to the South Carolina tourism industry.<a href="Hettena," title="NAACP Board Votes to Boycott South Carolina,">^10</a></p>
<p>On January 20, 2000, the <em>Los Angeles Sentinel</em> covered a march of several thousand demonstrators on the South Carolina Statehouse, demanding the Confederate flag be lowered from the dome. They also demanded the implementation of an official state holiday celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. The demonstration was organized by the NAACP in collaboration with the National Urban League and other religious, social, and academic groups, according to the <em>Sentinel</em>. Some of the protesters held signs reading “Your heritage is my slavery.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> 16-year-old Heather Showman, a white high-school student who was attending in support of the flag’s removal, told the <em>Sentinel</em>, “We need to get this flag off the Statehouse and promote racial unity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of the month, the <em>Sentinel</em> printed an AP report claiming that Columbia, South Carolina had already lost $2.6 million to the boycott. Both the NAACP and local tourism officials stated that over 90 groups had canceled or moved events they had planned to host in the state. Charleston was estimated to have lost $2 million in business revenue and Hilton Head Island, another popular site for tourists, lost around $1 million. The NAACP predicted that South Carolina would lose $43 million total, based on what groups told the NAACP they would have spent in the state had they not canceled their events. However, those numbers came only from groups who had canceled in October, and NAACP state director Dwight Hames estimated the real impact would be even greater.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Quick support for the boycott also rolled in from local and national authorities. Black churches called on shoppers to avoid shopping in South Carolina during the Easter holiday.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> The National Collegiate Athletic Association’s executive committee voted in favor of canceling future NCAA-sponsored events unless the flag was removed from the dome by August 11th, 2000, the date of the committee’s next meeting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> But the flag’s presence on statehouse grounds—and the NCAA basketball moratorium—would last for more than a decade.</p>
<p>South Carolina lawmakers attempted to appease both the NAACP and Confederate sympathizers by proposing ways to remove the flag from the dome without eliminating its presence from the capitol entirely. The Senate President Pro Tempore John Drummond suggested ceasing the flying of the flag and housing it in a glass case in the Statehouse rotunda instead, but nothing came of this proposition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> On May 10th, 2000, the same day that South Carolina celebrated its first official Confederate Memorial Day, the state House voted to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol dome and have it placed in front of a memorial to Confederate soldiers on statehouse grounds.<a href="Strope," title="South Carolina House votes to remove Confederate flag,">^17</a></p>
<p>This solution was unsatisfactory to many on either side of the issue, as the AP captured in a piece reprinted by the <em>New Pittsburgh Courier</em>. According to the article, both staunch flag supporters and members of the House Black Caucus tried to kill the bill. Flag supporters wanted to keep the flag on the dome, while many Black legislators were disturbed that the flag would be put in such a prominent place.<a href="Strope," title="South Carolina House votes to remove Confederate flag,">^18</a></p>
<p>Earlier that same day, the monument had been vandalized, with the words “Take it down, don’t put it here” spray-painted on its base. Protesters stood on the statehouse lawn and set Confederate and Nazi flags ablaze as they shouted “no compromise.” A spokeswoman for Governor Jim Hodges condemned the activity, stating, “We are up here trying to bring people together. It’s unfortunate that extremists on both sides of this issue are trying to drive people further apart.”<a href="Strope," title="South Carolina House votes to remove Confederate flag,">^19</a></p>
<p>The <em>Atlanta Daily World</em> highlighted the rift in the Black community that came as a result of this vote. NAACP President Kwesi Mfume mocked the Black state lawmakers who supported the compromise at that year’s NAACP annual meeting, calling them “weak-kneed, shifty-eyed, back-bending legislators.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> “Until the flag is removed from a place of sovereignty,” Mfume stated in his opening address. “There will be no compromise on the Confederate flag.” According to the report, “his remarks were met by applause and laughter.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Black newspapers also showed how different politicians approached the issue. The <em>New Journal and Guide</em> reported that while in South Carolina campaigning for the 2000 election, George W. Bush told the NAACP to stay out of the flag debate. At a Labor Day festival in Simpsonville, S.C., Bush said, “My advice is for people who don’t live in South Carolina to butt out of the issue.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> This statement was met with cheers from the crowd. Rev. H. S. Singleton, President of the Conway, SC branch of the NAACP described the statement as Bush, “wooing the white voters of South Carolina to support his candidacy.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Democratic candidates campaigned in the state ahead of the 2004 election, the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> made sure to reprint an article from the Associated Press describing two candidates’ views on the controversy. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Sen. Joe Lieberman from Connecticut, both seeking the Democratic nomination, had said they opposed the Confederate flag flying in front of the Statehouse, but “stopped short of endorsing the [NAACP] boycott.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> According to the report, Lieberman said he wanted to speak to those in opposition to the flag “to get a broader range of opinions on the boycott” and planned to stay in homes, not hotels, while in South Carolina.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The editorial sections of Black newspapers captured the lack of consensus among African-Americans over the value of the boycott, publishing articles representing varying opinions on the issue. For instance, The National Center for Public Policy Research (a conservative news outlet) organized Project 21, a platform to promote the viewpoints of moderate and conservative African-Americans.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kimberly J. Wilson, a member of Project 21’s National Advisory Board, wrote a scathing article attacking the NAACP’s boycott. In her editorial, Wilson compared the NAACP to her grandfather suffering from Alzheimer’s: “Both were once strong and proud and both have been laid low by mysterious internal forces.” She berated the boycott for imposing on the time that “many Black people traditionally take their ‘let’s go home and see the family down south’ vacations,” saying she could not “imagine anyone calling up Big Mama or Aunt Pearl to say. ‘Sorry, we can’t come this summer. The NAACP has declared a boycott.’”<a href="Wilson," title="NAACP's boycott is futile approach to minor issue,">^27</a> This type of article that made specific references to Black American cultural experiences would really only find an understanding audience in a Black newspaper.</p>
<p>Wilson further criticized the boycott for taking money away from Charleston, “a treasure trove of Black history and heritage, something that the NAACP apparently has forgotten.” She went on to write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been argued that the boycott is important because of the symbolism involved. I’m a little tired of symbolic gestures… I know what the Confederate flag represents… I certainly wouldn’t be sorry to see it banished from the State House, but Black America has some very serious non-symbolic problems that should be addressed first.<a href="Wilson," title="NAACP's boycott is futile approach to minor issue,">^28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the problems she listed were teen pregnancies, high infant mortality rates, the education gap, drug use, and the AIDS epidemic. Her article was published in the <em>New Pittsburgh Courier</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> as well as the <em>Michigan Chronicle</em> under a different title&quot;<a href="Wilson," title="NAACP's boycott is futile approach to minor issue,">^30</a></p>
<p>Earl Ofari Hutchinson had similar criticisms of the boycott, writing in an editorial in the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> that “at the same moment the NAACP saber-rattles state officials over a worthless flag, it’s deafeningly silent on the black poverty, school dropout, infant mortality, and victim of violence rates [among Black people] that are among the worst in the nation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>But op-ed pages in the Black press also carried many full-throated defenses of the NAACP’s move. Another article published by the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em> declared,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NAACP’s points about the flying of the Confederate flag are valid. If a swastika was flying in front of the New York legislative building and Jews raised a stink, no one would say a peep. The NAACP should be given the same type of respect.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the boycott brought attention to the issue of how the Confederate flag was revered by South Carolina, it did not bring about its downfall. One by one, groups that had initially participated in the boycott broke ranks. In 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference brought its baseball tournament back to South Carolina after initially respecting the boycott. According to the <em>Winston-Salem Chronicle</em>, Lonnie Randolph, president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, stated in response to this decision, “Initially, they supported the cause of respect, decency and equality for all people. Have they resorted to their old<br>
policy where they didn’t always feel that way?”<a href="Iacobelli," title="NAACP condemns ACC taking event to S.C.,">^33</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, the flag was <a href="https://falseimage.pennds.org/essay/Removal-of-the-Confederate-Flag-from-the-S">finally lowered from its position in front of the Statehouse</a> in the wake of new scrutiny following the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting. The Confederate memorial it flew alongside still stands as of this writing.</p>
