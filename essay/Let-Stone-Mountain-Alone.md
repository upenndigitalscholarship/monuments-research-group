There were three distinct waves of construction at Stone Mountain. The
first wave began in 1915 when Helen Plane suggested carving a small
monument to Lee in the mountain.[^1] Soon after, Gutzon Borglum---the Ku
Klux Klan affiliate who would later become the chief sculptor of Mount
Rushmore---was contracted to begin the work; his proposal was for a
literal army of carvings depicting every major Confederate leader.[^2]

The second wave began in 1925 when Borglum was removed and Augustus
Lukeman was contracted to head the operation, dramatically revising the
existing plans and blasting Borglum's work off the mountain.[^3] Damage
to the Stone Mountain Confederate Monument Association's reputation and
infighting between the Association and the landowner (himself a KKK
affiliate and insistent that Borglum be rehired) led to the fizzling out
of the project. This collapse occurred despite the minting of a
commemorative coin as part of a federal-scale fundraising initiative for
the monument, targeted explicitly at white Southerners.

The third wave commenced in 1964 after the state of Georgia bought Stone
Mountain and appointed George Weiblen as superintendent of the
carvers.[^4] This culminated in an official dedication in 1970, with
vice-president Spiro T. Agnew offering the guest oration.[^5]

The monument's history---and the mountain itself---were fused with the
rebirths of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 20^th^ century and again in
the mid-20^th^ century. Each wave of construction of the monument was
marked by special interest among Black newspapers, who in addition to
their blunt criticism of the project took particular care to note
mismanagement, controversy, and corruption attending the process.

In 2000, the *Atlanta Daily World* published a retrospective of Stone
Mountain, identifying it as a "Lost Cause shrine." The author
specifically highlighted the monument's links to Confederate identity in
its founding moment: "In 1915, Helen Plane, widow of a surgeon in the
Confederate army and president of the Atlanta chapter of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, proposed a 10-foot-wide statue of Lee's
head."[^6] As the *Kansas City Sun* wrote in 1921, Plane "sent for
Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor, to come to Georgia, to consider the
feasibility of a great sculptural monument to the Confederacy on the
wall of the mountain."[^7]

But Borglum returned with big ideas, proposing an image of an army
depicting every Confederate leader.[^8] Illustrations and a detailed
description of what the monument at Stone Mountain could look like were
published in 1914 by the *Philadelphia Inquirer*. Borglum's involvement
was halted in 1925 when funding ran dry.

Black newspapers frequently denounced the monument even in its very
early days. In 1924, the *Chicago Defender* republished a number of
statements offered by speakers at the dedication of the Lincoln
memorial. For instance, Rev. Charles L. Shergur, the chaplain of the
Grand Army of the Republic, was quoted referring to Stone Mountain's
proposed Confederate carvings as a "'monument to treason,' which would
soon be forgotten, while the memorials to Lincoln would live."[^9] Of
the Klansmen supporting the memorial at Stone Mountain, he said, "This
unnatural and un-American collection of mongrels must be destroyed for
the good of the country."[^10]

The *Chicago Defender* published an article discussing the construction
of the memorial in 1923:

> Gutzen \[sic\] Borglum, noted sculptor, promises to draw on the side
> of Stone Mountain in Georgia a tribute to the Confederate soldiers
> that will overshadow every other memorial in the world... The memorial
> will extend a thousand feet and more across the face of the mountain.
> Lee and Jackson will be seen standing reviewing the Confederate
> armies. Jefferson Davis will be carved looking down on his two
> heroes.[^11]

The *Defender* editors wryly added: "Very pretty, but don't let that
worry you. Whatever may be written on the side of Stone Mountain will
not disturb the Emancipation Proclamation."[^12] They also attacked what
they saw as the corrupt culture responsible for the monument: "The
South, home of determined unforgetting, unforgiving people, is behind
this monument to the Lost Cause."[^13]

Similarly, the *Pittsburgh Courier* published an article in 1925
decrying the Stone Mountain memorial:

> The South, aided by an obsession that the Rebellion was right and the
> abolition of Negro slavery wrong, decided to have carved on the face
> of Stone Mountain a living reminder of the cause to which they have
> dedicated their lives reminder of the cause to which they have
> dedicated their lives: human slavery and color selfishness. They hired
> a sculptor to carve the sign of rebellion on the mountains of Georgia,
> where passersby, in all the coming years, might know that the South
> believes in human slavery, and gave it up only at the point of the
> gun.

The article concluded with a blunt prescription: "Just enough work has
been done to remind the traveler that 'there is the lost cause,
conceived in hatred, and interrupted in its course for want of support.'
Nothing could constitute a more appropriate insignia to a lost cause
than an unfinished monument halted in its rise for want of sympathy. Let
Stone Mountain alone."[^14]
