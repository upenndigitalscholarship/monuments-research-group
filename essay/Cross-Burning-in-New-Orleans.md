In 1956, the *California Eagle* and the *Arizona Sun* published
simultaneous reports on a cross-burning in New Orleans. Both articles
noted that a sign had been placed above the blaze that read: "Keep our
kids safe from the black plague."[^1] Both reports also noted that the
cross-burning occurred near the monument of CSA President Jefferson
Davis. The *California Eagle* took the additional step of connecting the
cross-burning to an incident involving the director of the NAACP in
Florence, South Carolina. The director refused to use the back door at a
railroad station and was arrested.[^2]
