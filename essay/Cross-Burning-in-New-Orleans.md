In 1956, the *[California Eagle](https://www.newspapers.com/paper/california-eagle/26218/)* and the *[Arizona Sun](https://www.newspapers.com/paper/arizona-sun/30420/)* published simultaneous reports on a cross-burning in New Orleans. Both articles recorded that a sign had been placed above the blaze that read: "Keep our kids safe from the black plague."[^1] Both reports also noted that the cross-burning occurred near the monument of CSA President Jefferson Davis. The *California Eagle* took the additional step of connecting the cross-burning to an incident involving the director of the NAACP in Florence, South Carolina. The director refused to use the back door at a railroad station and was arrested.[^2]
