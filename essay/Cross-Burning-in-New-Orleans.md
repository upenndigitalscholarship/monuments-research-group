New Orleans Cross-Burning

In 1956, the *California Eagle* and the *Arizona Sun* published
simultaneous reports on a cross-burning in New Orleans. Both articles
noted that a sign had been placed above the blaze that read: "Keep our
kids safe from the black plague."[^1] Both reports also noted that the
cross-burning occurred near a statue of CSA President Jefferson Davis.
The *California Eagle* also connected the cross-burning to an incident
involving the director of the NAACP in Florence, South Carolina. The
director refused to use the back door at a railroad station and was
arrested.[^2]
