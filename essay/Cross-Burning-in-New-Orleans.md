In 1956, the _California Eagle_ and the _Arizona Sun_ published simultaneous reports on a cross-burning in New Orleans. Both articles recorded that a sign had been placed above the blaze that read: "Keep our kids safe from the black plague."[^1] Both reports also noted that the cross-burning occurred near the monument of CSA President Jefferson Davis. The _California Eagle_ took the additional step of connecting the cross-burning to an incident involving the director of the NAACP in Florence, South Carolina. The director refused to use the back door at a railroad station and was arrested.[^2]
