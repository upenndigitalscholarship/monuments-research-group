"To Perpetuate a False Image of History" -- Black Journalism in the Twin
Cities on Confederate Commemoration

Minnesota's Twin Cities---Minneapolis and St. Paul---share a strong
tradition of Black commentary on Confederate commemoration stemming back
to the late nineteenth century. The Twin Cities played host to four (or
five, depending on how you count) Black-led newspapers: the *Appeal*,
the *Twin City Star*, the *Western Appeal*, the *Minneapolis Spokesman*,
and the *St. Paul Recorder*. (The latter two were the same newspaper,
but titled differently depending on which side of the metro area they
were distributed.[^1]) Black journalists at these publications jointly
offered some of the most powerful voices naming the injustices
perpetuated by Confederate commemoration in the country.

The *Appeal* published a number of articles between 1887 and 1923 on
Confederate commemoration. The two earliest articles were from 1887,
both covering the emerging anchor of the future Monument Avenue---the
sculpture of Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia. These pieces discussed
the Parisian sculptor Antonin MerciÃ©, the plans for the monument, and
the laying of the cornerstone.[^2] In 1889, the *Appeal* published a
fiery op-ed on the Lee memorial, observing that "if anybody believes the
ex-Confederates are conquered because they are whipped, \[they are\]
sadly mistaken."[^3]

The *Appeal* continued to monitor and comment on commemoration and the
legacy of the Confederacy in the decades that followed. In 1902, for
instance, the *Appeal* cited a recent meeting of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy, at which "an immense confederate flag occupied the most
conspicuous place over the stage, high above the stars and stripes,"
noting that "The Southern people are still rebels."[^4]

The *Appeal* also responded to other publications around the country. In
1905, the *Appeal* quoted an article from the historically white
Charleston *News and Courier*, which stated that a "new North" will soon
emerge that will feature "statues of Lee and Stonewall Jackson... in the
squares of Northern cities as types of ideal Americans."[^5] The
*Appeal* responded with intense criticism to the notion of the
veneration of Confederates in Northern cities, arguing that the "new
North" was, in fact, actually the old North that discriminated against
Black people, citing an instance where Northerners burned orphan
asylums.[^6] The *Appeal* also commented on Confederate flags, the Ku
Klux Klan, Confederates honored in Statuary Hall, and monuments to
"Mammies."[^7]

Between 1915 and 1917, the *Twin City Star* published a cluster of three
articles covering the return of captured Confederate flags to the
South.[^8] These pieces spoke favorably of the stretching of a
"fraternal hand" from the North to the South to heal historic wounds. As
one such piece stated, "The time must come when there will be no more
'trophies' of the victory of one section of Americans over another."[^9]

The *Western Appeal* published three articles between 1887 and 1888 on
issues related to the national political environment, various small
monuments, and the return of captured Confederate flags.[^10] But on the
issue of President Grover Cleveland's return of flags to
ex-Confederates, the *Western Appeal* struck a much more bitter tone
than the *Twin City Star*. An 1887 piece stated:

> The trouble in this country today has been brought about by the
> wishey-washey gush and slush sentimental policy which has been
> followed since rebels were, not conquered, but only forced to lay down
> their arms. Had every man who swore allegiance to the Confederate
> government been for ever \[sic\] irrevocably disfranchised and
> debarred from holding any office of honor, trust, or emolument in the
> United States, Cleveland would not now be warming the presidential
> chair, nor would the most prominent foreign missions be filled by
> ex-Confederates. The country would be Republican, and the "Negro
> Problem" would not be the great bug-bear that it is at present. The
> old rebel spirit still lives.[^11]

The article went on to offer warning about the Southern-dominated
Democrats seeking control of the country, payment of Confederate debt,
reimbursement of slaveholders, and pensioning of Confederate soldiers.

This interest in the dynamic between Confederate commemoration and
policy continued into the 20^th^ century. The *Minneapolis Spokesman*
and *St. Paul Recorder* published a number of articles between 1937 and
1961 on a wide range of relevant topics, including the display of
Confederate flags, organizations like the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, and the Lost Cause.[^12] In a 1956 article, for instance,
the *Minneapolis Spokesman*/*St. Paul Recorder* criticized
interposition---the legal notion that states have the right to make
decisions about which federal policies are constitutional and so
selectively apply them to their citizenry. Interposition was the guiding
principle of the "massive resistance" movement of Southern states
refusing racial integration of schools.[^13] As the article stated: "We
hear a great deal about sovereign states at national political
conventions and in national political years. But the phrase, as applied
to the 48 states separately, is a myth. There is one sovereign state in
this country and one only, the United States of America."[^14]

And the promotion of the doctrine of interposition was directly linked
to Confederate commemoration: "There is a kind of false romanticism and
almost paranoid nostalgia about much of the southern agitation over the
supreme court segregation decision," the piece continued. "It is all
mixed up with 'Dixie' and the sudden rebirth of the Confederate flag.
But the modern world moves away from 'lost causes,' however romantic,
and there is nothing quite so dead as an idea tried and found
wanting."[^15] The resurgence in visibility of Confederate flags, as
these journalists saw it, was in support of the myth of state
sovereignty.

In a 1961 article, the *Minneapolis Spokesman*/*St. Paul Recorder*
recorded psychologist L. D. Reddick's view of the function of
Confederate commemoration:

> He said that most of this money is wasted and that much harm is being
> done to national unity and progressive ideas, for the South is gaining
> wide acceptance of what it looks upon as a glorious Lost Cause.
> Confederate flags, pageants, songs, and such organizations as the
> Daughters of the Confederacy and its junior branch, the Children of
> the Confederacy, pictures and monuments to Confederate heroes---all
> serve to perpetuate a false image of history and strengthen the old
> ante-bellum ideals of white supremacy and Negro inferiority.[^16]
