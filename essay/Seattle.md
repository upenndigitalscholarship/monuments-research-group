Far away from the towering monuments and waving flags of the former
Confederacy, the city of Seattle became a vital backdrop for Black
reporters to reflect on the implications of commemorating rebellion. Two
Seattle newspapers published a handful or articles on this theme: the
*Seattle Republican* and the *Enterprise*. Both condemned the veneration
and memorialization of the Confederacy and considered the deeper
cultural implications of commemoration itself.

Between 1903 and 1920, the *Seattle Republican* published a total of
four articles on Confederate commemoration. One such article discussed a
proposed monument dedicated to Black "mammies"; the other three focused
on Confederate likenesses in Statuary Hall at the Capitol. On the
"mammy" monument proposal, the *Seattle Republican* wrote:

> Erecting a million dollar monument to the black mammies of the South
> on the part of the Caucasian is not intended to be either edifying or
> elevating, save in the raising of the monument, but it is intended to
> keep alive the memory of the damnable days of the past, when the
> blacks as slaves served those would-be monument erectors as cruel and
> inhuman masters. Slavery was a blithing curse to this land of the free
> and the home of the brave, and the quickest way to ease our conscience
> about it is to forget it. Let the black mammies and Aunt Dinah's pass
> from us like a dream. The Negro does not appreciate such false homage,
> and if done, it will but widen the breach between the whites and the
> blacks of this country and serve neither no good purpose.[^1]

The "mammy" figure may not have been an explicit Confederate reference
like Lee or Davis in bronze, but the authors of this piece had no
question as to what was really being celebrated.

The *Seattle Republican* was equally acerbic toward the statue of CSA
General Robert E. Lee proposed for Statuary Hall in the Capitol
Building. In 1903, as the idea picked up steam in Virginia, the *Seattle
Republican* argued that if the statue was erected, then "no objection
should be made by it to the friends of Benedict Arnold placing a statue
of him likewise in the National Capitol."[^2] Their conviction was that
to commemorate a traitor to the country would be to dishonor the nation:
"no more shameful nor disgraceful scene could be enacted than the
placing of Lee's monument in the National capital."[^3]

Virginia's campaign succeeded, however, and in 1909, the year the statue
was placed in Statuary Hall, the *Seattle Republican* wrote:

> This man's memory is to be escutcheoned[^4] in the hall of fame of his
> country for his cussedness rather than for his patriotism. The country
> \[is\] honoring the memory of R. E. Lee, \[who\] struggled for four
> long years to smash into smithereens and was therefore a traitor
> \[t\]o her flag. Had Lee received his just deserts, he would have died
> a no less ignominious death than did Benedict Arnold. But a great
> change has come over the statesmen from the north these later years
> and in their effort to toady and truckle to southern sentiment, they
> not only give up all that their fathers fought, bled, and died for,
> but they absolutely insult the memories of the brave boys in blue who
> saved the Union from being destroyed by the red-handed murderers with
> Lee at their helm.[^5]

The comparison between Lee and Benedict Arnold sought to activate
American ideals of patriotism and loyalty---and contempt for treason.
And a sharp, intensely frustrated accusation was lobbied at northern
politicians whom these journalists saw as trying to curry favor with
Southern states---a common criticism levied by northern Black
newspapers. In a short article, the *Seattle Republican* also covered a
dispute between two veterans---one Confederate, one Union---over the
placing of the statue of Lee in Statuary Hall. According to the article,
the Confederate had callously assaulted the Union veteran.[^6]

Somewhat later, the *Enterprise* published two articles on confederate
commemoration in a three-month span. The first was a scathing commentary
on the Democratic National Convention of 1928. The commentary focused
primarily on political differences between the North and South,
surveying everything from immigration to taxation to labor to racial
tensions. The article concluded by bringing the point of racial
exclusion in the Democratic party and its discriminatory policies to the
forefront. The Northern Democrats in New York and elsewhere, according
to the article, yielded "to the southern race point of view in the
denial of the civil and human rights of colored citizens."[^7] The
articles urged readers to explore "the troth of northern and southern
democracy... at the unveiling of the monument to the Confederate General
Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, at Stone mountain," which was
supported by various Democratic politicians.[^8]

The *Enterprise* also commented in 1928 on the placement of Alexander H.
Stephens in Statuary Hall. The article began by quoting Stephens' 1878
declaration (made during his time in congress) that he "wish\[ed\] to
see the old relation restored."[^9] That "old relation" was enslavement.
The *Enterprise* responded by warning their audience of the importance
of forging alliances with antiracist whites:

> First, you have Confederate flags returned; then you see the vice
> president of the Confederacy honored in the Capitol he wanted to tear
> down. Our white people are getting together. If you are wise, you will
> join them, make merry with them and shake hands.[^10]

The *Enterprise* ended on a hopeful note, foretelling that acclaimed
Black Union veteran Henry Lincoln Johnson would someday be honored in
Georgia's Capitol as well.
