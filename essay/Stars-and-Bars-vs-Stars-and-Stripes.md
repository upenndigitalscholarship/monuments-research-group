From the end of Reconstruction well into the twentieth century, Black
journalists frequently criticized the use of Confederate
flags---especially, but not solely, the Confederate Battle Flag---in
public, particularly in official government capacities. A number of
editorials published in the Black press during this period stressed that
Confederate flags were unpatriotic and a threat to the sanctity of the
Union flag. The language used in these editorials reflects the deep
frustration of Black Americans toward the Confederate flags.

In 1890, the *State Capital* published an editorial (later reprinted by
the renowned *Richmond Planet*) condemning the displaying of the
Confederate Battle Flag at the dedication ceremony of the prominent
Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond. While they did not take issue with
the monument itself---they stated that General Lee "had many virtues
worthy of emulation"---they referred to the flag as an "ensign of
treason" and its display as a "shameful disregard for the flag of the
Union."[^1] They concluded the article by stating "we, as an American
citizen, offer our solemn protest and demand in the name of our fathers,
in the name of the constitution and in the name of every patriotic
impulse that such things not be tolerated."[^2]

One editorial published in the midst of the Cold War by the *Carolina
Times* declared that there was "no difference in displaying miniature
Confederate flags and displaying flags of the Soviet Union."[^3] They
urged Congress to pass a law banning the displaying of flags of any
nation, "existent or nonexistent," that has tried to overtake the United
States or taken up arms against it. They included the Confederacy in
this category along with England, Germany, and Japan.[^4]

In 1952, the *Philadelphia Tribune* highlighted conflict over the flying
of the Union and Confederate flags in their coverage of a proposed
constitutional amendment meant to prohibit the flying of any flag
besides the Stars and Stripes at any United States military facility.
The amendment, proposed by Republican Representative H.R. Gross of Iowa,
was reportedly intended to target the United Nations flag. However,
Representative L. M. Rivers of South Carolina asked if the amendment
would also prevent flags of the Confederacy from being flown. According
to the *Tribune*, "when the sponsor declared that it would, the
amendment went out the window."[^5] It was repudiated with overwhelming
numbers in the vote that followed.

In 1958, a bill was proposed in South Carolina that would require
Confederate flags to be treated with the same respect as the United
States flag. The *New York Amsterdam News* referred to this legislation
as "the first seeds of treason towards another civil war."[^6] The piece
expressed hope that if the bill was ever brought to the Federal Courts
it would be struck down since "we have men on the bench...who simply are
not as stupid and as un-American as the South Carolina Legislature and
its Governor."[^7]

A cartoon printed in the *Carolina Times* by African-American artist
Robert S. Pious in the run-up to the 1952 Democratic National Convention
in Chicago articulated this perspective visually. Titled, "Will It
Replace The Stars and Stripes At the Convention?," the cartoon is drawn
from the vantage of someone high up in a tree, looking down at a
flagpole on which the oblong Confederate Battle Flag has been raised.
Beside the flagpole is a branch of the tree labeled "States Rights,"
from which a noose has been hung. A shadowy figure standing at the
bottom of the pole and glaring upwards has been identified as
representing the Dixiecrats.[^8] This image encapsulated the deep,
prevalent suspicion toward the Confederate battle flag as a tool of
intimidation and an emblem of white supremacism.
