In 1937, the *Pittsburgh Courier* published an editorial written by
staff correspondent J.A. Rogers concerning stamps honoring Confederate
General Robert E. Lee.[^1] Although the article refers to April 15,
1937, as the day the "postage stamp \[was\] struck in honor" of Lee, it
seems more likely that it referred to a stamp printed several weeks
prior on March 23, 1937 depicting both Lee and Stonewall Jackson.[^2]
Rogers offered an extensive argument criticizing the choice to honor Lee
on the stamp.

Rogers believed that Lee was the "greatest of all the champions of
slavery," and that white Southerners had thus imagined him as a far more
majestic figure than he actually was. He was also a traitor. "Had Lee
succeeded," wrote Rogers, "the United States would now be two separate
nations."[^3] Striking a patriotic note, Rogers favorably compared the
"great, rich peaceful nation" of the United States to the situation of a
number of conflict-riven states in South and Latin America, contending
that this would have been the US's fate if Lee had triumphed.

Rogers also dispatched the claim that Lee was worthy of reverence on
account of his skill as a military commander, noting that skill placed
in service of an evil act does not merit commemoration:

> But if we are to admire mere skill then we must also laud the skilled
> counterfeiter, liar, thief, and all other ingenious outlaws. Lee used
> his ability, not to help humanity and his country, but to destroy
> them. The foremost apostle of slavery was a kindly, pious, god-fearing
> gentleman, we are told. But was not precisely the same thing said of
> Al Capone, who tried to restore the empire of Booze, after it had been
> declared illegal by the United States?[^4]

Extending the gangster analogy, the article noted that "by all accounts,
Capone was one of the kindliest, tenderest, and most generous of
mortals" and therefore was himself a "sort of Robert E. Lee by the
liquor rebels of Chicago and the nation."[^5] Rogers claimed that if
Capone had been able to "fight to restore King Alcohol" as Lee fought to
retain the institution of slavery, he might have found recognition in
congress instead of Alcatraz. Going even further, Rogers mused that
"there would be far greater justice honoring Al Capone than in honoring
Lee because the government itself routed the foes of Al Capone, namely,
the prohibition agents" whereas "What Lee stood for is still
outlawed."[^6] Capone's cause---the liquor trade---was eventually
vindicated. Lee's never was.

Rogers' final claim was that Lee's veneration arose primarily from the
refusal---on the part of his white Southern partisans---to accept their
own error:

> No matter what \[the\] personal qualities of Lee \[were\], he was
> responsible for an immense amount of bloodshed, suffering, misery, and
> loss of property. Most of the admiration for him today springs from
> sheer obstinacy. Even Southerners, who realize that it was for the
> best that the South lost, still regret \[the\] defeat of the
> Confederates.[^7]

Rogers offered, as an alternative, a stamp commemorating Black soldiers,
whom he held up as the deciding force that helped the Union win.
"Abraham Lincoln," he observed, "declared at least three times in his
writings that it was the Negro who saved the Union."[^8] The article
noted precedent for such an action: in France, a stamp had already been
printed honoring a Black woman.[^9] With this thought, Rogers reflected:
"Why then a stamp for those who would have destroyed the Union, and none
for those who saved it?"[^10]
