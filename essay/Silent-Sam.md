# The Rise and Fall of Silent Sam

The statue now known as "Silent Sam" was erected at the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) in 1913 and dedicated to the memory of
UNC students who had died fighting for the Confederacy during the Civil
War half a century earlier. The statue depicts a Confederate soldier in
the at-ready position---carrying a gun but no ammunition box. Over the
years, Silent Sam became the nexus for many demonstrations about racial
issues.[^1] The *Winston-Salem Chronicle* took a special issue in the
statue and kept readers up to date with the controversy by reprinting a
string of Associated Press articles.

On July 9, 2015, the *Chronicle* published an AP report that the statue
had been vandalized over the weekend. An unidentified individual had
spray painted the words "murderer" and "black lives matter" on the
monument.[^2]

In November of that same year, the *Chronicle* reprinted another AP
article reporting that UNC students had interrupted a university meeting
on race relations, chanting "Whose university? Our university!" The
students made many demands pertaining to racial issues on campus,
including the removal of the Silent Sam monument. The AP report noted
that a history task force had already made plans to place markers on
McCorkle Place, where the statue was located, to provide the monument's
full historical context. However, this plan did not include removal of
the monument itself, which was the students' main concern.[^3]

According to the AP, although many students, faculty, and alumni called
for the statue's removal, condemning it as a racist symbol, Chancellor
Carol Folt and other UNC leaders claimed a state law prevented the
school from removing the statue.[^4] The law she referenced was the 2015
Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act, requiring the
approval of the General Assembly for the removal of any monuments on
public property that commemorate "an event, a person or military service
that is part of North Carolina's history." [^5]

Finally, students took matters into their own hands. On Monday, August
20, 2018, students toppled the memorial during a rally for its removal,
bringing an end to Silent Sam's presence on campus.[^6]

The remains of the statue were initially moved to storage. In November
of 2019, UNC agreed to donate Silent Sam to the Sons of Confederate
Veterans, along with \$2.5 million for the costs of its preservation and
display. This agreement was made public minutes after the Confederate
group filed a lawsuit against the University for possession of the
statue.

However, in 2020, a judge overturned the settlement, arguing that the
group had "lacked standing to bring its lawsuit in the first place." The
statue was returned to the UNC system and was still in storage as of
2023.[^7]
