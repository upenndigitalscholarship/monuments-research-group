In the early 1980s, the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) was
embroiled in controversy over its ongoing use of the Confederate flag as
a school symbol. In spring of 1982, the University of Mississippi
student body elected its first Black cheerleader, John Hawkings, to the
school squad. But that fall, Hawkings refused to take part in the
traditional waving of the Confederate Battle Flag at the home opener.
Although Hawkins attended the game, the responsibility was given to
another cheerleader.[^1]

While the Confederate Battle Flag was not an official school symbol, it
was in regular use as an unofficial one. Hawkings' refusal to wave it
was the first incident in what became a larger confrontation between
Black students and the university the following spring.[^2] According to
the Black journalist organization *United Press International*, the
school's Black Student Union presented university officials with a
petition of 13 demands, including "removal of 'all racist symbols' such
as the Rebel flag, the Colonel Rebel mascot and the song 'Dixie' at
school events. They also called for more Black faculty, counselors,
Black Studies classes and job placement programs for Blacks."[^3] It is
unclear if these requests were made public by the Black Student Union or
if they were leaked to the student body by word of mouth.

But when the broader, predominantly white student population found out
about the demand to remove the flag from school events, the result was a
faceoff between white and Black students. The *Atlanta Daily World*, the
*Carolina Times*, and the *Afro-American* published reports by UPI
detailing the controversy. The UPI reported that on Monday, April 18th,
1983, "hundreds of white students gathered on campus...singing 'Dixie'
and chanting 'Save the Flag.'"[^4] The students then protested in front
of the house of Chancellor Porter Fortune before moving on to the
school's only Black fraternity house at the time, home of Phi Beta
Sigma.[^5]

While reports from UPI conveyed the bare facts of the event, it was a
series of op-eds that captured the emotional depth of the stand-off. The
UPI report on the April 18th protests, for instance, only stated "there
were no incidents,"[^6] a phrasing that conveyed no physical injury,
without documenting the psychological and traumatic effects of the
events. Leon Daniel, a UPI reporter, authored his own op-eds to
publicize the emotional response to the stand-off. In his reporting on
the April 18th demonstration, he interviewed a member of the Black
fraternity that was the site of the protests: "'I was afraid,' said
\[Danny\] Love, who described how he and several other brothers huddled
inside the only fraternity house for Blacks at Ole Miss, listening to
the mob outside scream 'nigger.'... 'We knew they were capable of
breaking into the house.'"[^7] Love's account, Daniel pointed out,
stands in stark contrast to the characterization of Ed Meek, Ole Miss'
director of the university's department of public relations, who claimed
"It was nothing but a spring pep rally."[^8]

Daniel reported on facets of the controversy that mainstream news
services were not capturing, emphasizing the impact of the volatile
white counter-protests---and the Battle Flag itself---on Black students.
He went on to write:

> Fear is what this story is all about, although some on both sides of
> the issue insist it is about...the confederate flag that white Ole
> Miss students are fond of waving at football games. To many of the 700
> or so black students, it seems that the 9,300 white students and
> thousands of white fans are waving 'racist symbols' in their
> faces.[^9]

Daniel also reported on how Black football players were affected,
something the other news service reports overlooked. White students at
Ole Miss insisted that the waving of the Confederate flags was meant to
inspire their football team, although almost half of the team at the
time was Black. When it came to the controversy, Daniel reported "The
black players do not say anything. That is because, according to the
black students, the players fear losing their athletic scholarships.
Coaches privately acknowledge the rebel flag hinders their efforts to
recruit black athletes."[^10]

Commemoration of the Confederacy was ingrained in the culture of the
campus and the surrounding town, another central issue in Daniel's
reporting. The demonstration outside of Phi Beta Sigma took place at the
beginning of Dixie Week, a "campus celebration of spring that features
food, fun, and lots of beer.... Rebel flags fly from windows at
fraternity houses and dormitories. Business establishments in town
display signs saying 'save the flag.'"[^11]

Daniel and other Black journalists also connected the incidents to riots
that had taken place two decades before, when James Meredith integrated
Ole Miss. When first reporting on the controversy, the UPI made sure to
note that Ole Miss was "the scene of a major outburst 20 years ago when
James Meredith finally entered school after 3,000 National Guard Troops
put down the riot."[^12] In a dramatic metaphor, Daniel described the
University as being "deflowered in 1962 in an explosion of rioting set
off by racial hatred" and claimed that in these new demonstrations, it
"has been violated again by those who claim to love her."[^13]

The day after the protests by white students, Black students held a
demonstration of their own. Hundreds of Black students gathered at the
main administration building, where they held hands and recited the
Lord's Prayer. This was followed by the singing of "We Shall Overcome,"
"the anthem of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s."[^14] Following
the Black students' calls for the Confederate flag to be disavowed by
the university, 3,000 Ole Miss students signed a petition urging
university officials not to do so.[^15]

In the weeks following the demonstrations, University Chancellor Porter
Fortune announced a new school policy that would prohibit the flag from
being used by the university as a school symbol, but stated it would
have no effect on the ability of individual students to wave or display
the flag themselves. He also stated that the school would continue to
use the Confederate Rebel as their mascot and that "Dixie" would still
be sung as an official school song. Black students met the announcement
with harsh criticism while white students celebrated what they saw as a
victory.[^16]

The controversy was brought back to the national spotlight in 1991, when
student Thomas Lowell Ketchum, Jr., brought the University to court over
what he claimed was "an illegal ban on use of the Confederate battle
flag" that violated his constitutional right to free speech.[^17] The
Associated Press reported that Ketchum sought "an order allowing the
campuswide \[sic\] sale, distribution, and display of the flag and
requiring an election among students to determine whether to officially
adopt the Confederate flag or any other banner as the school
symbol."[^18]

The university denied having any sort of ban on the flag. They had
adopted no new official policies on student use of the flag since
Chancellor Fortune's announcement in 1982. However, they had prohibited
campus-run outlets from selling the flag and placed new limits on the
size of banners waved at school functions. The Ole Miss Students
Association had also taken steps to reduce the Confederate flag's use,
such as voting "to discourage use of the flag by alumni at school
functions" and adopting a new flag sporting the letter *M* as the new
official symbol.[^19]

In 1997, the 52-member University Associated Student Body voted to
discourage the waving of the Confederate flag at school events among the
student body. This decision aligned with calls being made by then
Chancellor Robert Khayat and football coach Tommy Tuberville for the
flag-waving to cease.[^20]

As of 2023, Ole Miss sports teams are still using the label "the
Rebels."[^21]
