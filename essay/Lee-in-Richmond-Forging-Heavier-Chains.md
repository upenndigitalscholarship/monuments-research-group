"Forging Heavier Chains with Which to Be Bound": The Lee Statue on
Monument Avenue

Monument Avenue in Richmond, VA, was inaugurated in 1890 with what was
to be its largest statue. The colossal figure of Robert E. Lee on
horseback towered over the wide avenue located in an emerging
whites-only suburb of the former capital of the Confederacy. The Lee
monument was also the last Confederate sculpture on Monument Avenue to
be removed---in September 2021 amid a national movement against racial
injustice after the murder of George Floyd.[^1] But criticism of the
monument was not new. Black reporters were writing about the monument
extensively at the time of its planning and unveiling, most often
expressing sharp criticism of the decision to commemorate Lee.

The *Huntsville Gazette* published an article in 1887 reporting on
correspondence between Governor Fitzhugh Lee of Virginia (nephew of
Robert E. Lee) and Jefferson Davis (who did not die until 1889). Gov.
Lee invited Davis to a cornerstone-laying ceremony for the monument;
Davis replied that he would do everything he could to attend the
ceremony, but asked if the date could be changed to allow Confederate
veterans to avoid conflict with another ceremony taking place in Macon,
Georgia. The article does not evaluate the monument, only remarking that
"Arrangements have been projected for making the laying of the
cornerstone of the Lee monument an interesting event."

The unveiling of the actual monument on May 29, 1890, drew significant
attention from Black journalists. The *Richmond Planet* became a nexus
for Black commentary on the event from across the region, publishing and
reprinting almost two dozen pieces on the statue-raising in May and June
of that year. For instance, the *Planet* reprinted a short article from
the *National Home Protector* (Baltimore, MD, the precursor to the
*Afro-American*):

> The unveiling of the Lee monument adds another chapter to the history
> of the American nation that the next generation, both North and South,
> will no doubt read with regret. Though the general was guilty of
> treason against the United States government he bound himself under
> oath to support and fought bravely to forever establish and extend the
> accursed institution of human slavery; yet he possessed virtues which
> all fair-minded people appreciated. That he should have a monument
> erected in his memory by the people who followed him to defeat seems
> to be in the natural order of things.[^2]

The article's assessment of the situation was complex; Lee was to be
admired for his virtues as an individual, even if his cause was unjust.
The authors' chief criticism was that the *ceremony* became a pretext
for the display of an emblem of treason, the Confederate battle flag:

> But when the unveiling of the monument is used as an opportunity to
> justify the southern people in rebelling against the U.S. government
> and to flaunt the Confederate flag in the faces of the loyal people of
> the nation the occasion calls for serious reflection.[^3]

The great sin of the Lee monument in Richmond, then, was that it
promoted the iconography of traitors. Not only that, it betrayed Lee's
*own* noblest qualities, especially his graciousness in defeat:

> When General Lee furled his flag and presented his sword to his
> conquerors, he said succession is dead, and now, any attempt to
> resurrect the corpse of rebellion is not only an insult to the loyal
> people of the nation but is also casting a stigma on Gen. Lee's record
> as commander of the Confederate Army.

According to the article, those "virtues which all fair-minded people
appreciated" included honorable surrender. The South, in attempting to
revitalize the "corpse of rebellion," dishonored Lee's admirable
virtues.[^4]

The *Richmond Planet* also published their own vivid account of the
events at the unveiling ceremony, writing "Thursday, 29th inst. was a
memorable day for Richmond. Never has such a pageant assembled within
its confines" and speculating that "no where \[sic\] in the South has a
grander parade taken place."[^5] The article described all of the
commemoration for "General Robert E. Lee and the cause for which he
fought" including rebel flags hung everywhere and "long lines of
Confederate veterans" who attended to perform once again the "rebel
yell."[^6] "In no uncertain tones," wrote the *Planet* about the white
Southerners in attendance, it was revealed "that they still clung to
theories which were presumed to be buried for all eternity."[^7] The
rebel flags of the Lost Cause, "many of which had been perforated by
Union bullets," were met with great enthusiasm---"Cheer after cheer rang
out upon the air as they waved."[^8] The article also discussed the
unfinished Richmond City Hall, which was "covered with one mammoth
Confederate flag which extended the whole length of the building."[^9]

The *Planet* ended its report on a bleakly pessimistic note:

> The South may revere the memory of its chieftains. It takes the wrong
> steps in so doing and proceeds to go too far in every similar
> celebration. It serves to retard its progress in the country and
> forges heavier chains with which to be bound. All is over.[^10]

As another piece published in the *Planet* the same day put it, "This
gloficiation of States Rights Doctrine \[sic\]---the right of secession,
and the honoring of men who represented that cause, fosters in this
Republic, the spirit of Rebellion and will ultimately result in handing
down to generations unborn a legacy of treason and blood."[^11]

Two weeks later, the *Planet* published another article about the
unveiling, this time responding to a report from the *Washington Bee*,
another Black newspaper. The *Washington Bee* piece (which was fully
quoted by the *Planet*) commented on a report that "colored militia" had
participated in the unveiling ceremony and festivities. The *Washington
Bee* was extremely harsh in their assessment of these Black veterans:

> When will the Negroes learn sense? The idea of intelligent colored men
> making application to men to participate in a demonstration that was
> in honor of a man who attempted by force of arms to destroy a republic
> and to perpetuate slavery. It is a most damnable outrage on
> civilization; it is a mockery to the memory of those many thousand
> Union heroes that fell in defense of liberty.[^12]

In a disturbing turn that highlights the intensity of the anger this
report had caused, the *Washington Bee* went on to assert that

> Every Negro that participated in those ceremonies ought to have a rope
> around his neck and swung to the tail of the horse upon which the dead
> ex-Confederate is mounted.[^13]

This invective was particular spiteful in the context of ongoing
antiBlack violence and lynchings in the South. Then, as the *Planet*
response put it, the *Washington Bee* piece "concluded by
warmongering,"[^14] insisting that the Lee statue dedication "should
awaken the North. The South is just as ready to secede today as it was
in '61. Let the North beware and abandon its cowardice and strike for
liberty."[^15]

The *Planet* response to the *Washington Bee* piece, however, resolutely
denied that any Black militiamen participated in the ceremonies at all:

> Our contemporary is mistaken. No such application was made, and no
> Negro militia companies participated in the ceremonies. We trust that
> the correction will be made, and justice done the Afro-American
> militia of the Old Dominion.[^16]

But although the *Planet* was eager to redeem Black veterans, they did
not push back on the *Washington Bee*'s high passions against the "arch
traitors' ceremonies."[^17] This would seem to suggest tacit agreement
with both the claim that the Lee monument signaled white Southerners'
readiness to rebel---and the obligation for the North to "abandon its
cowardice and strike for liberty."
