In 1890, the district that would become Richmond's Monument Avenue was
still largely rural. But changes began that year with the placing of
Monument Avenue's first and largest statue. Antonin MerciÃ©'s colossal
figure of Robert E. Lee on horseback towered over the wide avenue of the
newborn whites-only suburb of the former capital of the Confederacy. The
Lee monument was also the last Confederate sculpture on Monument Avenue
to be removed---in September 2021---amid a national movement against
racial injustice after the murder of George Floyd.[^1] But criticism of
the monument was not new. Black reporters covered the monument campaign
from the mid-1880s through to its unveiling, mostly expressing sharp
criticism of the decision to commemorate Lee, though an 1887 piece from
the *Huntsville Gazette* merely reported on some correspondence
surrounding the cornerstone-laying and remarked that "Arrangements have
been projected for making the laying of the cornerstone of the Lee
monument an interesting event."[^2]

The unveiling of the actual monument on May 29, 1890, drew significant
attention from Black journalists. The *Richmond Planet* became a nexus
for Black commentary on the event from across the region, with the paper
publishing or reprinting almost two dozen pieces on the statue-raising
in May and June alone. For instance, the *Planet* reprinted a short
article from the *National Home Protector* (Baltimore, MD, the precursor
to the *Afro-American*):

> The unveiling of the Lee monument adds another chapter to the history
> of the American nation that the next generation, both North and South,
> will no doubt read with regret. Though the general was guilty of
> treason against the United States government he bound himself under
> oath to support and fought bravely to forever establish and extend the
> accursed institution of human slavery; yet he possessed virtues which
> all fair-minded people appreciated. That he should have a monument
> erected in his memory by the people who followed him to defeat seems
> to be in the natural order of things.[^3]

The article's assessment of the situation was complex; Lee was to be
admired for his virtues as an individual, even if his cause was unjust.
The authors' chief criticism was that the *ceremony* became a pretext
for the display of an emblem of treason, the Confederate battle flag:

> But when the unveiling of the monument is used as an opportunity to
> justify the southern people in rebelling against the U.S. government
> and to flaunt the Confederate flag in the faces of the loyal people of
> the nation the occasion calls for serious reflection.[^4]

The great sin of the Lee monument in Richmond, then, was that it
promoted the iconography of traitors. Not only that, it betrayed Lee's
*own* noblest qualities, especially his graciousness in defeat:

> When General Lee furled his flag and presented his sword to his
> conquerors, he said secession is dead, and now, any attempt to
> resurrect the corpse of rebellion is not only an insult to the loyal
> people of the nation but is also casting a stigma on Gen. Lee's record
> as commander of the Confederate Army.

According to the article, those "virtues which all fair-minded people
appreciated" included honorable surrender. The South, in attempting to
revitalize the "corpse of rebellion," dishonored Lee's own wisdom.[^5]

The *Richmond Planet* also published their own vivid account of the
events at the unveiling ceremony, writing "Thursday, 29th inst. was a
memorable day for Richmond. Never has such a pageant assembled within
its confines... no where \[sic\] in the South has a grander parade taken
place."[^6] The article described all of the accoutrements brought out
for "General Robert E. Lee and the cause for which he fought," including
rebel flags hung everywhere and "long lines of Confederate veterans" who
performed once again the "rebel yell."[^7] "In no uncertain tones,"
wrote the *Planet* about the white Southerners in attendance, it was
revealed "that they still clung to theories which were presumed to be
buried for all eternity."[^8] The rebel flags of the Lost Cause, "many
of which had been perforated by Union bullets," were met with great
enthusiasm---"Cheer after cheer rang out upon the air as they
waved."[^9] The article also discussed the unfinished Richmond City
Hall, which was "covered with one mammoth Confederate flag which
extended the whole length of the building."[^10]

The *Planet* ended its report on a bleakly pessimistic note:

> The South may revere the memory of its chieftains. It takes the wrong
> steps in so doing and proceeds to go too far in every similar
> celebration. It serves to retard its progress in the country and
> forges heavier chains with which to be bound. All is over.[^11]

As another piece published in the *Planet* the same day put it, "This
glorification of States Rights Doctrine \[sic\]---the right of
secession, and the honoring of men who represented that cause, fosters
in this Republic, the spirit of Rebellion and will ultimately result in
handing down to generations unborn a legacy of treason and blood."[^12]

Two weeks later, the *Planet* published a new article about the
unveiling, this time responding to a report from the *Washington Bee*,
another Black newspaper. The *Washington Bee* piece (which was fully
quoted by the *Planet*) commented on a rumor that "colored militia" had
participated in the unveiling ceremony and festivities. The *Washington
Bee*'s assessment of these Black veterans was harsh:

> When will the Negroes learn sense? The idea of intelligent colored men
> making application to men to participate in a demonstration that was
> in honor of a man who attempted by force of arms to destroy a republic
> and to perpetuate slavery. It is a most damnable outrage on
> civilization; it is a mockery to the memory of those many thousand
> Union heroes that fell in defense of liberty.[^13]

In a disturbing turn of phrase that highlights the intensity of the
anger caused by the report, the *Washington Bee* went on to declare

> Every Negro that participated in those ceremonies ought to have a rope
> around his neck and swung to the tail of the horse upon which the dead
> ex-Confederate is mounted.[^14]

This invective was particular spiteful in the context of ongoing
anti-Black violence and lynchings in the South. The *Washington Bee*
piece, as the *Planet* put it, "concluded by warmongering,"[^15]
insisting that the Lee statue dedication "should awaken the North. The
South is just as ready to secede today as it was in '61. Let the North
beware and abandon its cowardice and strike for liberty."[^16]

The *Planet* response to the *Washington Bee* piece, however, resolutely
denied that any Black soldiers participated in the ceremonies at all:

> Our contemporary is mistaken. No such application was made, and no
> Negro militia companies participated in the ceremonies. We trust that
> the correction will be made, and justice done the Afro-American
> militia of the Old Dominion.[^17]

But although the *Planet* was eager to redeem Black veterans, they did
not push back on the *Washington Bee*'s high passions against the "arch
traitors' ceremonies."[^18] This would seem to suggest tacit agreement
with both the claim that the Lee monument signaled white Southerners'
readiness to rebel---and the obligation for the North to "abandon its
cowardice and strike for liberty."
