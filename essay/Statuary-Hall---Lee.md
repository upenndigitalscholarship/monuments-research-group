In the waning years of the Civil War, the Old Hall at the United States
Capitol Building was converted into a statuary chamber. The vision
informing the space was that each state would contribute two statues of
prominent figures to the hall. In 1909, the Commonwealth of Virginia
elected to send statues of George Washington and Confederate general
Robert E. Lee. Black journalists were acutely interested in the decision
to celebrate Lee at the US Capitol and published a raft of commentary in
the years that followed, most of it critical.

The *Indianapolis Star* published a lengthy editorial in 1909 which
opposed Lee's presence in the Capitol. "Veterans of the Civil War, who
fought for the flag to which Lee was disloyal," the authors contended,
"will be shocked at \[the statue being draped in a Union flag\] and
disposed to regard it as a direct and intentional insult to all men who
loved and were faithful to the Union."[^1] The article suggested that
the decision to celebrate Lee actually exposed a "secret shame felt by
present-day Virginians over his course."[^2] According to the article,
the representation of the Union flag would only confound future efforts
to comprehend what the Civil War had been about:

> as time goes on and coming generations, unknowing or forgetful of the
> history and issues of the war, look on this statue they will naturally
> assume, seeing the flag, that Lee was a soldier in the Union. A
> hundred years from now, few who look at the figures in the hall of
> fame will recall that he was other than loyal.[^3]

The article affirmed that many other men were "greater than Lee" and
more fit choices to represent Virginia---Thomas Jefferson, Chief Justice
Marshall, and James Madison.[^4]

In 1910, the *Afro-American* (Baltimore, MD) published a piece reporting
on speeches made at a ceremonial function for the Grand Army of the
Republic of Massachusetts. Statements denouncing the decision to place
the statue of Lee in the Capitol generated "great enthusiasm" among the
assembly.[^5] A resolution was put forward that demanded "Virginia
withdraw the statue of Lee and if the state refused to do so the
congress would be petitioned to order its removal." In response to these
actions, the "entire body of delegates arose as one man, cheering
wildly."[^6]

The *Monitor* (Omaha, NE) and the *Afro-American* published the same
article in 1926 opposing the placement of the likeness of Lee---or that
of any other Confederate figure---in Statuary Hall. The article quoted
the president of the Washington D.C. chapter of the NAACP, Neval H.
Thomas, who stated: "The many illustrious Negroes who have rendered
distinguished service in every noble endeavor in our country's history
have no place there, and we feel that in glorifying our worse \[sic\]
enemies the nation discourages patriotism and self-forgetful
service."[^7] The *New York Amsterdam News* also reported Thomas's
remarks on Confederates in Statuary Hall, noting that Lee, "who received
his military training in the Union military academy at West Point and
rewarded the splendid gift with treason, is honored by the presence of
his marble likeness there among those of the patriots and other
benefactors of the United States."[^8]

One piece from this period stands apart from the generally critical eye
cast on the Lee statue by Black journalists. In 1910, the *Kansas City
Sun* republished an article (originally found in *Collier's Weekly*)
criticizing the controversy about Virginia choosing Lee. They wrote:

> It is surprising that any discussion can be carried on about whether a
> statue of Robert E. Lee should be placed in Statuary Hall in the
> capitol at Washington, this being one country. Lee's exceptionally
> fine character is now appreciated as clearly at the North as at the
> South.

The article focused on the argument that the decision to celebrate Lee
was Virginia's and Virginia's alone: "the National government and the
people of the country at large have nothing to do with the
decision."[^9] Echoing the Lost Cause myth of the Civil War as driven by
a philosophical argument over "States' Rights," the article claimed that
outsiders claiming their "opinions are of any weight in a matter which
belongs exclusively to \[Virginia\]" was a "supererogation."[^10]

In 2020, the Commonwealth of Virginia voluntarily removed the Lee bronze
in Statuary Hall and replaced it with a statue of anti-segregation
activist Barbara Rose Johns. Valentine's Lee statue was placed in the
Virginia Museum of History and Culture in Richmond, where it serves as
an anchor for an exhibit on the shifting politics of Confederate
commemoration.
