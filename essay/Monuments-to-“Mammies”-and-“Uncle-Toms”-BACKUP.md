Monuments to "Mammies" and "Uncle Toms"

Between the late 19th century and the 1930s, Southern legislators and
chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy initiated a number
of efforts to erect monuments to Black "mammies" and other slaves who
had stayed loyal to their white masters during the civil war. However,
their efforts to erect a national "mammy" monument in 1923 ultimately
failed.

In January 1923, Mississippi Senator John Sharp Williams introduced a
bill to erect a monument in D.C. memorializing the "Faithful Colored
Mammies of the South."[^1] A news report from the Black newspaper *New
Journal and Guide* covering the campaign notes the prominent involvement
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).[^2] The planned
location for the monument was on Massachusetts Avenue (where a statue of
an Eastern European nationalist leader has stood since 2002).[^3]

Several sculptors submitted designs to the UDC in hopes of securing a
commission. One model by American architect Ulric Dunbar showed a Black
woman wearing the typical "mammy" garb of handkerchief and apron,
standing atop a podium with the word "Mammy" engraved into it. She holds
a white baby in her arms while two more white children pull at her
apron. On a set of steps leading up to the podium, a child reaches for
Mammy while a man appears to comfort him.[^4]

The proposed legislation sent the Black community into an uproar. An
editorial in *The New York Age* described receiving a flood of letters
regarding the monument, mostly in protest of the proposal. Readers
insisted that the monument was both degrading and hypocritical. One
letter pointedly asked, "What honor is it to erect a monument to the
'Black Mammy' and at the same time burn her grandsons at the stake?"[^5]
This theme---highlighting the hypocrisy of the government supposedly
honoring Black life while continuing to allow rampant lynching---was
repeated throughout the letters.

In another editorial letter published in *The New York Age,* Mattie
Fagan, a Black woman, declared:

> Until the lynchings, burnings at the stake, segregations,
> disenfranchisements, peonage...and all of the other insults,
> indignity, injustices and outrages heaped upon us and upon our
> soldiers, has been done away with...I protest against the erection of
> any such monument anywhere in these United States of ours.[^6]

Neval H. Thomas, President of the Washington, D.C. chapter of the NAACP
from 1925 until his death in 1930, wrote to *The Washington Post*: "It
cannot be forgotten that the same Southern spirit that wishes to raise
this monument raises mountains of barriers across the path of Negro
progress, hence we must 'fear the Greeks, though bearing gifts.'" This
letter was reprinted by the Black paper *New Journal and Guide* in their
report on the controversy.[^7]

It was not just the hypocrisy that caused Black people to rally against
the monument, but also a sense that the monument was a disservice to the
memory of slavery. *The Broad Ax* reprinted an editorial from
*Blackstone Valley News* proclaiming that "the condition of the slave
woman was so pitiable, hopelessly helpless that it is difficult to see
how any woman, where white or black, could take pleasure in a marble
statue to perpetuate her memory."[^8]

Various Black organizations and individuals wrote messages of dissent to
legislators. One such appeal was made by Mrs. Charlotte Hawkins Brown
from Sedalia, N.C, who served in executive roles in both the Federation
of Colored Women's Clubs and the National Association of Colored Women's
Clubs, associations created at the turn of the 20th century with the
goal of uplifting Black women and championing their civil rights. In a
telegram to North Carolina Congressman Charles M. Stedman---a vocal
supporter of the bill in the House---Brown wrote:

> The intelligent Negro women of the South appreciate your motive in
> advocating some kind of a memorial to the faithful services of Negro
> women during slavery, but deplore the fact that it should take the
> form of a 'mammy monument.'...If the fine spirited women, Daughters of
> the Confederacy, are desirous of perpetuating their gratitude, we
> implore them to make their memorial in the form of a foundation for
> the education and advancement of the Negro children descendants of
> those faithful souls they seem anxious to honor.[^9]

These appeals were ignored and the bill was officially passed in March
of that same year. A report by the *Afro-American* claimed that the bill
was passed out of respect for Senator Williams, who was about to retire,
making the bill the last he would ever introduce in his career.[^10]

[The idea of a "mammy" monument was not offensive to all Black citizens,
however. Black papers captured these countervailing opinions, as well.
Another editorial in *New Journal and Guide* supported the bill and
called the dedication of a monument to mammies "a gracious thing for the
Daughters of the Confederacy to do." It went on to argue that this
project was proof that the Daughters "]{.mark}cannot hate the
descendants of those 'Colored Mammies' as much as some would make it
appear." The piece finished by calling on the Black community to also
honor "mammies," as they

> were the mothers who delivered us into life and no stronger and more
> heroic women than they ever took hold of the problem of freedom with
> more resolution and success in helping their husbands to make homes
> and educate their children after the Civil War.[^11]

The author contended that "as their sons," Black people should build a
"mammy" monument of their own.

In April 1923, a dean at Howard University, Dr. Kelly Miller, referenced
the controversy in his address proposing a race conference[^12] for the
following year. He stated that he was in support of the monument, but
that it was too soon after the war for the monument to be built.
Nonetheless, he stated that

> a few centuries from now when the stigma of the horrible conflict
> shall have been forgotten, then a monument should be built... as a
> fitting tribute to this "Nature-Woman"\... who could take the infant
> child of another race on one knee and the infant of her own flesh and
> blood on the other and out of the Christlike fullness of heart pacify
> both.[^13]

*The Richmond Planet* also published an editorial applauding the
proposed monument, claiming that as offspring of the "black mammy," "any
monument which shall be a testimonial of affection to them shall be
appreciated by us." The editorial claimed that remembering the mammies
would be beneficial to the Black community:

> If the new Negro in his demand for equal rights and privileges would
> mix with his educational ability, the breeding, which carries with it
> the good manners and friendly disposition of these good old souls,
> their way would be easier and they would attain sooner the goal they
> seek as full-fledged American citizens of this Republic.[^14]

*The New York Age* reprinted this piece in an editorial of their own in
which they also issued a response:

> Good manners and a friendly disposition are not incompatible with
> educational ability, but they are hard to maintain in the face of the
> denial of justice and human rights. Insistence upon these rights is
> too often misconstrued as a breach of manners and denoting an
> unfriendly spirit.[^15]

Williams' "Mammy Monument" bill died three months after its
introduction, when Congress adjourned without taking further action to
bring it into law.[^16]

While this specific controversy brought a new level of attention to
"mammy" monuments in the news, Black papers had published editorials
about such monuments before. In 1914, an editorial was published in *The
Colorado Statesman* stating that at a recent reunion of Confederate
veterans in Jacksonville, a motion was passed encouraging the capital
city of every former enslaving state to erect a "loyal slave" monument.
The author of the editorial declared "the fact that the white men dared
leave their wives and children to the protection of black men who were
their slaves is in itself a tribute of which the American negro can
always be proud"[^17] and applauded the veterans' proposition to
memorialize the occurrence.

Another editorial from 1911 printed in *The New York Age* argued that
existing loyal slave monuments were proof that slavery was not an
"unutterably evil institution" -- otherwise, the author stated, the
slaves would have run away when the war broke out -- and implied the
existence of "a kindly \[sic\] feeling between master and slave."[^18]

Still, an editorial by Roscoe Simmons in the *Chicago Defender* in
1921---applauding the demise of one such "mammy" statue proposal in
D.C.---would seem to speak for the majority. "Good news for you. You
have been worried to death over the 'Mammy Statue," he began, before
explaining that he had spoken to a highly placed source in Washington,
who had asked Simmons to "tell the Colored people that Washington
authorities will not see them humiliated in this way." To which Simmons
praised the petitioners and fundraisers who had fought the monument and
pronounces the outcome "Very, very good."[^19]
