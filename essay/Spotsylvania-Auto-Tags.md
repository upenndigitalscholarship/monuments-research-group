For their 1961 license plates, Spotsylvania County in Virginia issued a
design bearing the Confederate battle flag. As reported by the *Carolina
Times*, African-American citizens of the county quickly objected to the
plates' logo. The Virginia NAACP sent a petition to the Spotsylvania
County Board of Supervisors, requesting an immediate suspension of the
plates. The petition, part of which was reprinted in the *Times*
article, declared,

> To us the Civil War stands for the supreme effort of our country to
> insure freedom \[sic\]...and we feel personally degraded in being
> compelled to imply that we thank the Confederacy for doing its best to
> keep us in physical bondage.[^1]

W. Lester Banks, the Virginia NAACP's executive secretary, argued that
the Confederate insignia "should be protested with 'the same degree of
patriotism and fierceness as one protests and rejects the Nazi
swastika.'"[^2]

However, despite protests from the NAACP and other, the County Board of
Supervisors insisted nothing could be done about the license plates. An
Associated Negro Press (ANP) report, reprinted by the *New Journal and
Guide*, noted that the auto-tags had been on sale since March 15th. The
NAACP's petition was not issued until May. The chairman of the Board of
Supervisors reportedly said that because most of the plates had already
been distributed, there was no way to rectify the issue.[^3] (This ANP
report was also reprinted in the *Philadelphia Tribune* under a
different title.[^4])

This state of affairs seems to have continued for over 50 years. In
2015, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles began recalling license
plates with the Confederate emblem.[^5] At the same time, plates
celebrating Confederate General Robert E. Lee, were still being issued,
though commonwealth officials had begun to organize the retirement of
that design as well.[^6]
