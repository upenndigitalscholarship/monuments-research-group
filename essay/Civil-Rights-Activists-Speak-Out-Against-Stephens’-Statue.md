# Civil Rights Activists Speak Out Against Stephens' Statue

In April 1926, two Black-owned newspapers reprinted the same letter
written by Neval Thomas, a civil rights activist who was then serving as
president of the Washington, D.C. NAACP branch. Thomas spoke against
plans to erect a statue to Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the
Confederacy in National Statuary Hall. The *New York Amsterdam News*[^1]
and the *Pittsburgh Courier*[^2] both made sure the words of the
nationally recognized activist were delivered to their readers.

Thomas addressed the letter to the architect of the United States
Capitol, arguing that Stephens "wears the stain of helping to found the
only government in the history of the world whose sole purpose was the
perpetuation of slavery." Thomas referenced specific instances of
injustice, proclaiming that Stephens

> gave all of his genius to that spirit that murdered Lovejoy, assaulted
> Sumner, dragged Garrison through the streets of Boston, placed a price
> upon the head of Frederick Douglass and brought infinite sorrow and
> suffering to the millions of noble men and women in black.

Thomas made clear his opinion on the symbolic power of monuments,
writing,

> The urge for the admission of these two statues springs from the
> unrepentant spirit that wants the union to admit that the South was
> right in seeking to wrong the Union. It knows that cold marble can
> proclaim its cause, especially when it is placed in the very center
> and heart of government.

The federal government ignored these arguments, and a statue of
Stephens---a gift from the state of Georgia---was placed in Statuary
Hall in 1927. Mary Church Terrell, another nationally renowned civil
rights leader, wrote an editorial published in the *New Journal and
Guide*, condemning the statue. She noted that

> In no other country in the wide world would such a scene be possible
> as was witnessed in the Capitol a few days ago, when the statue of a
> man who had tried to destroy his government was received with
> gratitude and praise by one of its highest representatives!

The representative Terrell referred to was then-Vice President Charles
Dawes, who gave a speech at the statue's dedication. Terrell warned that
this "attitude toward a traitor" would teach American youth that the
"effort to wreck and ruin the government under which one lives" is a
celebratory act.

Georgia, Terrell argued, had "added insult to injury" through the act of
"giving to the Nation's Hall of Fame the statue of a man who helped her
try to cut the country in two."[^3]
