On June 23, 2015, nine Black worshippers were murdered in a racially
motivated attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston, South Carolina.

Prior to the shooting, the gunman, Dylann Roof, had posted photos of
himself online brandishing the Confederate Battle Flag and burning or
defiling United States flags.[^1] In the wake of the attack and the
circulation of these photos, new attention was brought to the
Confederate flag flying on statehouse grounds in Columbia, S.C.

The *Winston-Salem Chronicle* observed this controversy closely,
regularly republishing Associated Press (AP) reports, editorials, and
cartoons. These articles provided the timeline of events and captured
both sides of the flag issue. But the *Chronicle* also published
editorials which vividly demonstrated how many African-Americans saw the
future of the flag tied up with the future of equality in the US.

One editorial, written by US Representative Alma S. Adams (NC-12)
published in the *Chronicle* two days after the shooting, suggested that
in response to the shooting, "we should put our faith to action, making
a conscious decision to be more than empty drums that have long lost
their melodies." Adams continued,

> In South Carolina, the Confederate flag---an unequivocal symbol of
> hate---remains on statehouse grounds. We must demand the flag be
> removed immediately---we cannot let icons of racism fly free within
> our society.[^2]

That same day, the *Chronicle* published another editorial calling for
the removal of the flag. The author, James B. Ewers, Jr., called the
flag a symbol of enslavement and remarked that "it is difficult for me
to see how justice and equality can prevail when there is a symbol of
injustice that serves as a constant reminder."[^3] If South Carolina
wanted to make progress on race relations following the shooting, he
argued, the flag needed to come down.[^4]

A cartoon by African-American illustrator Ron Rogers, also printed in
the *Chronicle*, expressed a similar criticism. The cartoon depicts a
jail cell, the bars of which have been ripped open. The cell is labeled
"Racism, Hate"---the occupants that had broken free. A Confederate flag
flies atop the cell. In front of the cell two men stand guard, with one
saying to the other "I thought we had this under control." The cartoon
mocks the notion that any place that flies the Confederate flag has
successfully tamed the powers of racism and hate.[^5]

The governor of South Carolina quickly joined the call for the flag's
removal. According to an AP report reprinted in the *Chronicle*,
Governor Nikki Haley proclaimed that the flag's use as a hate symbol by
Roof "made it too divisive to display in such a public space."[^6] Haley
remarked that she hoped removing the flag would allow the state to "move
forward in harmony."[^7]

Although she acknowledged the hateful way Roof had used the flag, Haley
resisted labeling the flag itself as an inherently bigoted symbol. She
stated,

> For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are
> noble. The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters
> in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag. In no way does
> he reflect the people in our state who respect, and in many ways,
> revere it.[^8]

This opinion was echoed by the head of the South Carolina branch of the
Sons of Confederate veterans in a statement that was partially printed
in the same AP report in the *Chronicle*. Mr. Land Summers asked the
public to not "associate the cowardly actions of a racist to our
Confederate Banner. There is absolutely no link between The Charleston
Massacre and The Confederate Memorial Banner. Don't try to create
one."[^9]

On July 6, the South Carolina Senate voted 37-3 in favor of removal.
According to the AP report on the vote, several white senators who had
once supported the flag's presence on Statehouse grounds, stated that
they now understood "why their black colleagues felt the flag no longer
represented the valor of Southern soldiers" but the brutality and racism
of slavery.[^10]

It was also up for discussion whether or not the pole itself would
remain standing. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia,
expressed fear that any flag raised to the Confederate soldiers monument
would become "the new vestige of racism."[^11] On July 9, the South
Carolina State House also voted in favor of the flag's removal and on
July 10, the flag was officially taken down.[^12]

The *Winston-Salem Chronicle* reprinted a statement from U.S.
Representative G. K. Butterfield (NC-1), Chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, applauding South Carolina for lowering of the flag.
Butterfield referred to the action as part of "progress towards a
brighter future."[^13]

Not everyone agreed that the flag's removal indicated meaningful change.
An AP article on the matter, reprinted in the *Winston-Salem Chronicle*,
noted that Rev. Joseph Darby, a friend of one of the nine slain at
Emanuel AME, thought it "a bit premature to declare this a new 'New
South,' as some commentators have suggested." Darby said he was hopeful
it would be a first step in a journey towards bringing about real
equality and justice, but asserted, "if nothing else changes, it'll
ultimately be cosmetic."[^14]

When former SC governor Haley began her presidential campaign in 2023,
she received criticism from conservatives for her decision to remove the
flag and from liberals for her refusal to condemn the flag itself.[^15]
