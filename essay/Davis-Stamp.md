In 1960, a proposal was put forward to issue a postage stamp honoring
CSA president Jefferson Davis. The *New Journal and Guide* (Norfolk, VA)
published a sharply critical response by a local Episcopalian priest
(and future bishop), Rev. Dr. Richard B. Martin.

Martin began by pointing out that Davis "wanted slavery everywhere."
Even before Secession, he wrote, as a freshman senator, Davis "fought to
have all of the territories opened to slavery."[^1] According to Martin,
Davis was also a "man of severe blunders" and "was not a good judge of
men and was constantly hampered by blunders in handling people."[^2]
Overall, he wrote, "Davis was a man controlled by strong pride and
prejudice."[^3]

Martin went on to discuss Davis's treason---his being "twice indicted"
but never convicted. "After General Lee," the article asserted, "Jeff
Davis is probably the second idiot in the minds of political leaders in
the South."[^4] Martin also expressed his frustration with the various
"commemorative Davis markers and monuments in several states and
numerous cities across the South."[^5] Martin's concluding line
expressed his deep hostility to Confederate commemoration, whether in
monumental or postage stamp form: "In the drama of the crucifixion of
the Carpenter of Nazareth," he observed, "there are names like Judas and
Pontius Pilate, but we don't bother to name churches in their memory."
