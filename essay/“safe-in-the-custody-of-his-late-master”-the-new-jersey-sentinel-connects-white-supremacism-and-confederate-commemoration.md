The *[Sentinel](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.proxy.library.upenn.edu/apps/readex/publication-browse?p=EANAAA&t=pubname%3A12B71455EDA827F8%21Sentinel&year=1882)* of Trenton, New Jersey was in press for only a short span between 1880 and 1882. In that brief run, they published three articles commenting on Confederate commemoration. Two of these articles covered the erection of monuments in Culpeper, Virginia and Frederick, Maryland. These items were [one-sentence briefs](https://falseimage.pennds.org/essay/numbers-and-news-briefs-in-kansas%E2%80%99-black-press/).[^1] Although the *Sentinel* did not comment at length, its editorial staff were clearly concerned with what was happening just south of the Mason-Dixon line. 

The *Sentinel* also published one editorial directly criticizing Confederate commemoration. In a harsh response to an article in the white-run Memphis Appeal, the *Sentinel* rejected the confidence “that the Negro’s rights will be safe in the custody of his late master.”[^2] The article questioned whether the South was truly repentant and trustworthy, questioning the notion that “the Southern fire eater is no more; that the South has accepted the results of the war, and that popular sentiment in that section is as loyal to the Union as it is in New Jersey.”[^3] As evidence of this continued disloyalty, it referenced the dedication of the monument in Antietam National Cemetery. At its dedication, the *Sentinel* noted, “the name of Jefferson Davis was loudly cheered, and mention of the emancipation proclamation of Abraham Lincoln, brought forth hisses from many throats.”[^4]

The article—published just before the 1880 election—also attacked Democratic politicians who continued to insist that their primary constituency was white voters.[^4] The editorial concluded with a series of frustrated questions: 

> Have we been told the truth? Does anyone really believe that the south has accepted the results of the war? That the finances of the country will be safe under Southern control? Would the black man who voted for Wm. H. English have an ounce of self-respect? As long as Mr. Ludlow studiously avoids asking the support of any but white men, would it be wise for black men to vote for him? Would it be right to vote for either?[^6]

The *Sentinel* offered a straightforward diagnosis of the link between white supremacism, the Democratic party, sectional resentment, the assault on Black voting rights, and Confederate commemoration.

Hill, later moved to Richmond, but removed in 2023 following pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement and reinterred in Culpeper’s Fairview Cemetery. The Frederick monument was erected by the Ladies Monumental Association of Frederick County to honor the unknown Confederate dead in Mount Olivet Cemetery. The statue and accompanying Confederate flags were destroyed by Black Lives Matter protestors in 2020.
