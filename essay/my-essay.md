title: Happy Things
---
You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Brown is such a nice color. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.

This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You have to make these big decisions.

It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.

This is a fantastic little painting. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Now then, let's play. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.
