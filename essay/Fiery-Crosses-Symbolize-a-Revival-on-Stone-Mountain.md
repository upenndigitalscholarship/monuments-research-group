In 1945 and 1946 alone, at least five crosses were burned atop Stone
Mountain, the largest Confederate Monument in existence.[^1] These
cross-burnings signaled an attempt to jump-start both the third
iteration of the Ku Klux Klan---with the second Klan having been
inaugurated on Stone Mountain thirty years previous---and the stalled
effort to complete the carvings on the mountain face.

Whereas Mount Rushmore's location is remote, Stone Mountain is sited
just a few miles outside Atlanta. The *New York Age* reported that
during World War II, cross burnings and Klan organizing efforts were
largely suppressed due to the need for unity in winning the war.
However, the Klan---well aware of its historical successes in postwar
periods---hoped that postwar racial tensions would create favorable
conditions for a resurgence.[^2]

Black newspapers across the country consistently covered the activities
of the Klan on Stone Mountain. The induction ceremonies of the Klan
involved cross burnings that could be seen from a distance of sixty
miles.[^3] These ceremonies attracted thousands of Klan sympathizers,
with participation sometimes exceeding 3,000 hooded members and 7,000
spectators.[^4] In 1945, an article from the *Pittsburgh Courier*
reported a KKK membership of 30,000 across the South.[^5] An article
from the *Detroit Times* that same year stated that Georgia alone had
20,000 members, while the editor of the *Negro News*, C.W. Rice, drew on
a *Weekly Review* (AL) report of 25,000 members in that state.[^6] By
the end of May 1946, at least 700 new members had been initiated on top
of the mountain.[^7]

Black journalists sharply criticized this "vigorous organizing" on Stone
Mountain, connecting it to a reign of racist terror emerging in the
region.[^8] One account from the *Pittsburgh Courier* reports, "Here in
the center of a hotbed of Ku Klux Klan fanaticism, it is evident that
even God means nothing, as incendiarists have burned down every negro
church and school in the community."[^9] Some accounts from the
*Pittsburgh Courier* praised the actions of states like New York and
California for taking actions against the Klan's new visibility.[^10]
Klan activities were characterized as impeding progress in diplomatic
ambitions because it was embarrassing for the nation. As the *Pittsburgh
Courier* wrote: "The revival of the Ku Klux Klan weakens America's
position in the world... in the same way as the loss of a major battle
would do."[^11] Even groups like the Colored Funeral Directors
Association of Georgia condemned the Klan activities at Stone Mountain,
going on record to state, "\[We\] hereby deeply deplore and strongly
condemn the Ku Klux Klan in our state and urge our law enforcement
officers to counteract and prevent such barbaric and lawless
demonstrations that took place on Stone Mountain recently."[^12]

The *Cleveland Call* held nothing back in its coverage of the horrific
activities at the monument:

> More than 700 white-sheeted Georgia Crackers assembled last week atop
> historic Stone Mountain near here to herald the rebirth of the
> notorious Ku Klux Klan, dedicated to 'white supremacy.' The bigoted
> bed-sheeters held a 2-hour, torch-lighted celebration a few hundred
> yards from the Confederate memorial which never should have been
> built.[^13]
