In 1909, the settlement of Fairview, KY dedicated a park to CSA
President Jefferson Davis. The park commemorated Davis on "the 101^st^
anniversary of \[his\] birth... at his birthplace," according to an
article covering the event in the *Richmond Planet*.[^1] A monument was
designed and finally completed in 1924, which at the time was believed
to be "the second highest shaft in the United States" at 361 feet,
falling short only of the Washington Monument in D.C.[^2]

When the monument came up, the *Chicago Defender* published a column by
Roscoe Simmons, a Black journalist and Republican activist---known as a
powerful orator---describing his encounter with the obelisk, which he
referred to as "that reminder of a great intellect, a lost cause, the
weakness of human judgment, the hand of God."[^3]

Simmons described how he had traveled with a group of Black
intellectuals to Attucks High School to discuss the state of Black
education. This caused him to reflect:

> Suppose Davis and Lee had succeeded. Maybe no Attucks High, no Lawyer
> Robinson, no Teacher Sleet, no Postelle to receive a fortune from a
> wise, sturdy father, no Elkton School, no pen in this writer's hand,
> no place for him to do much 'speaking,' no time for you to read.

Simmons' criticisms of Davis were measured---perhaps a reflection of the
difficulty of speaking out against white supremacy in the 1920s, even in
the North---but he offered an incisive criticism of the commemoration of
Davis. The political vision defended by Davis and Lee would have left
Blacks almost entirely without education, opportunity, or leisure 60
years later.
