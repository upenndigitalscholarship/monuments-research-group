The Weakness of Human Judgement: The Jefferson Davis Monument in
Kentucky

In 1909, the settlement of Fairview, KY dedicated a park to Confederate
President Jefferson Davis. The park commemorated Davis on "the 101^st^
anniversary of \[his\] birth... at his birthplace," according to an
article covering the event in the *Richmond Planet*.[^1] A monument was
designed and finally completed in 1924, which at the time was believed
to be "the second highest shaft in the United States" at 361 feet, after
the Washington Monument in D.C.[^2]

When the monument came up, the *Chicago Defender* published a column by
Roscoe Simmons, a Black journalist and Republican activist---known as a
powerful orator---describing his encounter with the obelisk, which he
referred to as "that reminder of a great intellect, a lost cause, the
weakness of human judgment, the hand of God."[^3]

Simmons described traveling to a school with a group of Black
intellectuals to comment on the state of Black education, musing:

> Suppose Davis and Lee had succeeded. Maybe no Attucks high, no Lawyer
> Robinson, no Teacher Sleet, no Postelle to receive a fortune from a
> wise, sturdy father, no Elkton school \[where Attucks high was
> located\], no pen in this writer's hand, no place for him to do much
> "speaking," no time for you to read.

Simmons' criticisms of Davis are measured---perhaps a reflection of the
difficulty of speaking out against white supremacy in the 1920s, even in
the North---but he poses an unmistakable criticism of the commemoration
of Davis, noting that the political vision defended by Davis and Lee
would have left Blacks almost entirely without dignity, education, or
opportunity 60 years later.
