During Jim Crow, the state of Mississippi chose CSA president Jefferson
Davis as one of two Mississippians to be honored in Statuary Hall at the
United States Capitol. The statue was sculpted by Augustus Lukeman (who
had briefly been contracted to work on Stone Mountain) and finished in
1931.

The campaign to place a Davis statue in the Capitol did not go
unremarked by Black journalists. In a 1914 article, the *Appeal* (St.
Paul, MN) roundly condemned the effort. The unsigned opinion piece
highlighted Davis's role in the perpetuation of racial injustice. Davis,
the article stated, was "the arch traitor who tried to disrupt the Union
in order that human slavery should be preserved and extended."[^1] The
article criticized the state which had submitted Davis---"the more or
less grand old Commonwealth of Mississippi"---for disenfranchising Black
Americans and "contribut\[ing\] to the world the greatest number of
lynchings which have taken place in any state in the Union."[^2]

The article concluded with a stirring indictment linking contemporary
anti-Black violence and discrimination to the heritage of the
Confederacy:

> What is to be the end of a Nation which permits its citizens to be
> murdered by mobs; accepts as Senators men who openly boast in the
> Senate Chamber of the murder of their fellows; a Nation which attempts
> to degrade some of its citizenry by discriminatory laws and allows the
> segregation as lepers of men and women who have won their places after
> severe test; and in spite of the prejudice against them? A statue of
> Jeff Davis in the Capitol at Washington! God preserve our Nation![^3]

Mississippi's Davis statue remains in Statuary Hall as of the time of
this writing.
