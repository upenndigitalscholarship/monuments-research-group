Black reporters covering the [late-1940s revival of the Ku Klux Klan](https://falseimage.pennds.org/essay/Fiery-Crosses-Symbolize-a-Revival-on-Stone-Mountain) on top of the future Stone Mountain Confederate memorial noted that the Klan consistently used a distinct rhetorical technique: identifying themselves and their issues as "local," even when they were anything but. The _Pittsburgh Courier_ reported that the Klan leadership claimed their "activities... are inspired by local organizations and cannot be linked up with any national program." The cross burnings and initiations, as the _Pittsburgh Courier_ put it, were made out to be "purely local."[^1]

Likewise, the _Cleveland Call and Post_ reported that the "Grand Dragon" Dr. Samuel Green characterized a 1946 Klan demonstration on Stone Mountain as "strictly a Georgia affair"---even as he admitted that "many members attended from neighboring states."[^2] Their sources noted 11 buses at the event that bore license plates from states like Maryland and Tennessee and that there were hundreds of cars that lined the road all the way to Stone Mountain.[^3] The _New York Age_ reported that "chartered buses brought in Klansmen from Alabama, Tennessee, Florida" and "license plates on private automobiles indicated attendance was from 14 states."[^4] In a separate piece of reporting, the _Pittsburgh Courier_ stated that busloads of Tennesseans from across the state were at the Stone Mountain cross burning on May 10^th^, 1946.[^5]

Black journalists investigating the Klan documented both the interstate networks that made Klan activities possible and also the shrewd rhetorical techniques Klan officials used to pass themselves off as a grassroots organization.
