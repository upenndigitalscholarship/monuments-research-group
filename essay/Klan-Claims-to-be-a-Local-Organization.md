Black reporters covering the late-1940s revival of the Ku Klux Klan on
top of the Confederate memorial at Stone Mountain, GA, noted that the
Klan consistently used a distinct rhetorical technique: identifying
themselves and their issues as "local," even when they were anything
but. The *Pittsburgh Courier* reported that the Klan leadership claimed
their "activities... are inspired by local organizations and cannot be
linked up with any national program." The cross burnings and
initiations, as the *Pittsburgh Courier* put it, were made out to be
"purely local."[^1]

Likewise, the *Cleveland Call and Post* reported that the "Grand Dragon"
Dr. Samuel Green characterized a 1946 Klan demonstration on Stone
Mountain as "strictly a Georgia affair"---even as he admitted that "many
members attended from neighboring states."[^2] Their sources noted 11
buses at the event that bore license plates from states like Maryland
and Tennessee and that there were hundreds of cars that lined the road
all the way to Stone Mountain.[^3] The *New York Age* reported that
"chartered buses brought in Klansmen from Alabama, Tennessee, Florida"
and "license plates on private automobiles indicated attendance was from
14 states."[^4] In a separate piece of reporting, the *Pittsburgh
Courier* stated that busloads of Tennesseans from across the state were
at the Stone Mountain cross burning on May 10^th^, 1946.[^5]

Black journalists investigating the Klan documented both the interstate
networks that made Klan activities possible and also the shrewd
rhetorical techniques Klan officials used to pass themselves off as a
grassroots organization.
