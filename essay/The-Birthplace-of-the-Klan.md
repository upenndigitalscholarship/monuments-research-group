The Birthplace of the Klan

The history of the Ku Klux Klan is deeply intertwined with Stone
Mountain. Black journalists often referred to Georgia as the Klan's
birthplace and consistently linked Stone Mountain to their denouncement
of the Klan's actions.

The Klan was originally formed by Confederate veterans in Pulaski, TN
following the end of the Civil War. But this first iteration of the Klan
was quashed by federal efforts during Reconstruction, including
legislation specifically targeting Klan tactics.

Even before the beginning of the engraving work that would create the
Confederate memorial on the mountain's face in the mid-1920s, the Klan
began its rebirth at the mountain's summit. The second Klan was
inaugurated there in 1915 and grew rapidly as the circle of targets for
hatred expanded to include Jews, Catholics, and immigrants, as well as
Black Americans. The second Klan was a spent force by the late 1930s,
but after the Second World War, a new iteration of the Klan
emerged---once again using Stone Mountain as a backdrop.[^1]

Black reporters saw the Klan and Stone Mountain as irrevocably
connected. In 1945, C.W. Rice, the editor of the *Negro Labor News*, was
quoted by the *Weekly Review* (AL) speaking of Stone Mountain as "where
the huge burning cross was lighted a few nights ago," though he also
noted that their intimidation efforts had not impeded Black advancement:
"in Georgia, the birthplace of the Klan, Negroes have made the greatest
progress." He went on to talk about how the Klan's ambitions were a
"losing battle" and that "despite all this race hating propaganda, the
white people of the South are changing their minds in favor of helping
the Negro to find his place beside other citizens."[^2]

The *Detroit Tribune* also observed the Klan cross-burning that year,
reporting that "not many nights ago, on the summit of Stone Mountain
over-looking Atlanta, the lurid glare of a fiery cross pierced the
darkness for miles around. It had been placed there by the Klan... \[The
Klan\] is reorganizing in Georgia, the home of its birth, just as it did
after World War I." The article goes on to say that the Klan "has no
right to exist."[^3] Despite the historic origins of the Klan in
Tennessee, these Black reporters identified Georgia as the "mother" of
the Klan---and Stone Mountain as its cradle.[^4]

Other Black reporters accurately located the Klan's historic birthplace
in Pulaski, but still identified Georgia as the epicenter of the Klan's
horrors. The *Cleveland Call and Post* reported the "traditional fiery
cross" that "was burned as a climax of celebration, and Dr. Samuel Green
of Atlanta, current 'Grand Dragon' of the order which had its formation
on Halloween night, 1866, in Pulaski, Tenn. \[sic\]" The *Call and Post*
fiercely condemned the monument and the Klan activities, calling the
Klansmen "white-sheeted Georgia Crackers" and the "bigoted
bed-sheeters."[^5]

Likewise, an editorial in the *California Eagle* signed "C.A.B." linked
the events on Stone Mountain to rising Klan activities in Los Angeles.
The editorial noted that the Klan attacks and intimidations in Los
Angeles had led to stabbings and beatings. "Forging a chain of hate and
making its bid for White Supremacy across the nation from Stone Mountain
in Georgia to California," the piece stated, "the Klan is staging a
reign of terror against Negro, Chinese, Jewish and Mexican Americans."
The author identified Stone Mountain as the spiritual fountainhead of
the Klan, spreading its venom all the way to the west coast.
