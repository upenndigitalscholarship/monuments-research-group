In July 1999, the National Convention of the NAACP voted in favor of a
tourism boycott of South Carolina. They were responding to the state's
continued display of the Confederate Battle Flag on the dome of their
capitol building.[^1] The boycott was proposed by the South Carolina
chapter of the NAACP.[^2] At the time, South Carolina was the only state
to fly the Confederate flag itself at its capitol, although Georgia and
Mississippi had incorporated parts of it into their own state flags.[^3]

The flag hadn't been there for long. It was originally raised above the
South Carolina Capitol in 1961, purportedly to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the start of the Civil War, and was then left in place.
Several failed attempts to bring it down had been made since this
initial gesture.[^4]

Even though the resolution to boycott could not be officially ratified
until the NAACP's October meeting, the effects of the proposal came
almost immediately. The boycott made national headlines and the actions
of the NAACP and the effort was well-documented by the Associated Press
(AP), whose reports were often reprinted in Black newspapers. Some Black
publications, such as the *Winston-Salem Chronicle* and *Atlanta Daily*
*World*, also undertook original coverage of the boycott.

Following the NAACP convention, the *Winston-Salem Chronicle* reported,
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) canceled its
convention in Charleston, S.C. The national president of the SCLC,
Martin Luther King, III, stated "Many people try to justify the display
of the Confederate flag by saying it is a symbol of Southern heritage.
But in reality, the flag began to be displayed conspicuously as a symbol
of resistance to the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme
Court decision."[^5] He went on to "urge every organization and
corporation who loves justice to join this effort to push America back
from the brink of senseless tribalism."[^6]

The boycott also received the support of civil rights activist Rev.
Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native.[^7] By early August, NAACP
leadership was already coming up with ways to specifically target
companies who supported pro-flag lawmakers. According to a report by the
Associated Press, the group collected the financial disclosure forms of
fourteen senators and seven House members, most of whom supported
keeping the Confederate flag above the capitol dome. The forms listed
political contributions, income, and business connections.[^8]

In mid-October, the tourism boycott was officially ratified, mobilizing
"all \[NAACP\] chapters and members to not visit or spend dollars in
South Carolina until the flag is removed," according to NAACP
spokeswoman Sheila Douglas.[^9] Associated Press reports quantified the
impact of the boycott: an AP report reprinted in both the *Winston-Salem
Chronicle* and *Atlanta Daily World* stated that following ratification,
several groups from across the country canceled meetings and events
originally planned to be hosted in South Carolina. This included the
Seventh-Day Adventist Church, which had planned to bring 7,000 people to
Columbia for a four-day meeting. That event alone, the article stated,
would have contributed an estimated \$500,000 to the South Carolina
tourism industry.[^10]

On January 20, 2000, the *Los Angeles Sentinel* covered a march of
several thousand demonstrators on the South Carolina Statehouse,
demanding the Confederate flag be lowered from the dome. They also
demanded the implementation of an official state holiday celebrating
Martin Luther King, Jr. The demonstration was organized by the NAACP in
collaboration with the National Urban League and other religious,
social, and academic groups, according to the *Sentinel*. Some of the
protesters held signs reading "Your heritage is my slavery."[^11]
16-year-old Heather Showman, a white high-school student who was
attending in support of the flag's removal, told the *Sentinel*, "We
need to get this flag off the Statehouse and promote racial unity."[^12]

At the end of the month, the *Sentinel* printed an AP report claiming
that Columbia, South Carolina had already lost \$2.6 million to the
boycott. Both the NAACP and local tourism officials stated that over 90
groups had canceled or moved events they had planned to host in the
state. Charleston was estimated to have lost \$2 million in business
revenue and Hilton Head Island, another popular site for tourists, lost
around \$1 million. The NAACP predicted that South Carolina would lose
\$43 million total, based on what groups told the NAACP they would have
spent in the state had they not canceled their events. However, those
numbers came only from groups who had canceled in October, and NAACP
state director Dwight Hames estimated the real impact would be even
greater.[^13]

Quick support for the boycott also rolled in from local and national
authorities. Black churches called on shoppers to avoid shopping in
South Carolina during the Easter holiday.[^14] The National Collegiate
Athletic Association's executive committee voted in favor of canceling
future NCAA-sponsored events unless the flag was removed from the dome
by August 11th, 2000, the date of the committee\'s next meeting.[^15]
But the flag's presence on statehouse grounds---and the NCAA basketball
moratorium---would last for more than a decade.

South Carolina lawmakers attempted to appease both the NAACP and
Confederate sympathizers by proposing ways to remove the flag from the
dome without eliminating its presence from the capitol entirely. The
Senate President Pro Tempore John Drummond suggested ceasing the flying
of the flag and housing it in a glass case in the Statehouse rotunda
instead, but nothing came of this proposition.[^16] On May 10th, 2000,
the same day that South Carolina celebrated its first official
Confederate Memorial Day, the state House voted to remove the
Confederate flag from the Capitol dome and have it placed in front of a
memorial to Confederate soldiers on statehouse grounds.[^17]

This solution was unsatisfactory to many on either side of the issue, as
the AP captured in a piece reprinted by the *New Pittsburgh Courier*.
According to the article, both staunch flag supporters and members of
the House Black Caucus tried to kill the bill. Flag supporters wanted to
keep the flag on the dome, while many Black legislators were disturbed
that the flag would be put in such a prominent place.[^18]

Earlier that same day, the monument had been vandalized, with the words
"Take it down, don't put it here" spray-painted on its base. Protesters
stood on the statehouse lawn and set Confederate and Nazi flags ablaze
as they shouted "no compromise." A spokeswoman for Governor Jim Hodges
condemned the activity, stating, "We are up here trying to bring people
together. It's unfortunate that extremists on both sides of this issue
are trying to drive people further apart."[^19]

The *Atlanta Daily World* highlighted the rift in the Black community
that came as a result of this vote. NAACP President Kwesi Mfume mocked
the Black state lawmakers who supported the compromise at that year's
NAACP annual meeting, calling them "weak-kneed, shifty-eyed,
back-bending legislators."[^20] "Until the flag is removed from a place
of sovereignty," Mfume stated in his opening address. "There will be no
compromise on the Confederate flag." According to the report, "his
remarks were met by applause and laughter."[^21]

Black newspapers also showed how different politicians approached the
issue. The *New Journal and Guide* reported that while in South Carolina
campaigning for the 2000 election, George W. Bush told the NAACP to stay
out of the flag debate. At a Labor Day festival in Simpsonville, S.C.,
Bush said, "My advice is for people who don't live in South Carolina to
butt out of the issue."[^22] This statement was met with cheers from the
crowd. Rev. H. S. Singleton, President of the Conway, SC branch of the
NAACP described the statement as Bush, "wooing the white voters of South
Carolina to support his candidacy."[^23]

When Democratic candidates campaigned in the state ahead of the 2004
election, the *Winston-Salem Chronicle* made sure to reprint an article
from the Associated Press describing two candidates' views on the
controversy. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Sen. Joe Lieberman from
Connecticut, both seeking the Democratic nomination, had said they
opposed the Confederate flag flying in front of the Statehouse, but
"stopped short of endorsing the \[NAACP\] boycott."[^24] According to
the report, Lieberman said he wanted to speak to those in opposition to
the flag "to get a broader range of opinions on the boycott" and planned
to stay in homes, not hotels, while in South Carolina.[^25]

The editorial sections of Black newspapers captured the lack of
consensus among African-Americans over the value of the boycott,
publishing articles representing varying opinions on the issue. For
instance, The National Center for Public Policy Research (a conservative
news outlet) organized Project 21, a platform to promote the viewpoints
of moderate and conservative African-Americans.[^26]

Kimberly J. Wilson, a member of Project 21's National Advisory Board,
wrote a scathing article attacking the NAACP's boycott. In her
editorial, Wilson compared the NAACP to her grandfather suffering from
Alzheimer's: "Both were once strong and proud and both have been laid
low by mysterious internal forces." She berated the boycott for imposing
on the time that "many Black people traditionally take their 'let's go
home and see the family down south' vacations," saying she could not
"imagine anyone calling up Big Mama or Aunt Pearl to say. 'Sorry, we
can't come this summer. The NAACP has declared a boycott.'"[^27] This
type of article that made specific references to Black American cultural
experiences would really only find an understanding audience in a Black
newspaper.

Wilson further criticized the boycott for taking money away from
Charleston, "a treasure trove of Black history and heritage, something
that the NAACP apparently has forgotten." She went on to write,

> It's been argued that the boycott is important because of the
> symbolism involved. I'm a little tired of symbolic gestures...I know
> what the Confederate flag represents...I certainly wouldn't be sorry
> to see it banished from the State House, but Black America has some
> very serious non-symbolic problems that should be addressed
> first.[^28]

Among the problems she listed were teen pregnancies, high infant
mortality rates, the education gap, drug use, and the AIDS epidemic. Her
article was published in the *New Pittsburgh Courier*[^29] as well as
the *Michigan Chronicle* under a different title"[^30]

Earl Ofari Hutchinson had similar criticisms of the boycott, writing in
an editorial in the *Winston-Salem Chronicle* that "at the same moment
the NAACP saber-rattles state officials over a worthless flag, it's
deafeningly silent on the black poverty, school dropout, infant
mortality, and victim of violence rates \[among Black people\] that are
among the worst in the nation."[^31]

But op-ed pages in the Black press also carried many full-throated
defenses of the NAACP's move. Another article published by the
*Winston-Salem Chronicle* declared,

> The NAACP's points about the flying of the Confederate flag are valid.
> If a swastika was flying in front of the New York legislative building
> and Jews raised a stink, no one would say a peep. The NAACP should be
> given the same type of respect.[^32]

While the boycott brought attention to the issue of how the Confederate
flag was revered by South Carolina, it did not bring about its downfall.
One by one, groups that had initially participated in the boycott broke
ranks. In 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference brought its baseball
tournament back to South Carolina after initially respecting the
boycott. According to the *Winston-Salem Chronicle*, Lonnie Randolph,
president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, stated in response
to this decision, "Initially, they supported the cause of respect,
decency and equality for all people. Have they resorted to their old
policy where they didn't always feel that way?"[^33]

Ultimately, the flag was finally lowered from its position in front of
the Statehouse in the wake of new scrutiny following the Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church shooting. The Confederate memorial it flew
alongside still stands as of this writing.
