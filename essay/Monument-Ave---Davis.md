On June 3, 1907, A monument to Jefferson Davis, the only president of
the CSA, was unveiled on Monument Avenue in Richmond. This followed the
erection of a massive statue of General Robert E. Lee in 1890 and a
monument to J.E.B. Stuart just four days prior. The creation of the
Davis monument---as grand as it was---resulted in very little notice
among Black journalists. Black newspapers published no editorials on the
unveiling of the Davis monument, but two of them offered brief coverage.

The *Washington Bee* published an article simply stating that the
"statue of Jefferson Davis was unveiled last Monday." They also noted
that "At the request of Gen. Stephen D. Lee all trains on the Atlanta
and West Point Railroat \[sic\] were stopped last Monday afternoon for
five minutes in honor of the unveiling of the Jefferson Davis Monhment
\[sic\]."[^1]

The *Iowa State Bystander* (later just the *Bystander*) republished an
Associated Press report about the unveiling in Richmond. This article
praises the proceedings, describing how "Under a perfect sky... the
armies of gray passed through the streets of Richmond Monday and, out on
splendid Monument Avenue, unveiled an enduring memorial to Jefferson
Davis."[^2]

It seems that the *Bystander* shortened the AP article that was picked
up in mainstream newspapers. The title of the *Bystander* piece---
"Davis Statue Unveiled"---is also less celebratory than the heading
chosen by other venues; the *Daily Press* (Newport, VA) went with
"Splendid Memorial to South's Great Leader" and the *Montgomery
Advertiser* (Montgomery, AL) ran their version under the title "South
Sets Aside Eternal Shaft to Perpetuate Dead Leader's Fame."[^3]

It may also be the case that the *Bystander* picked up the story with
little intent to offer political commentary; the Bystander Publishing
Company's motto, after all, was "Fear God, Tell the Truth, and Make
Money."[^4]
