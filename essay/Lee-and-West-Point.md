Robert E. Lee's military career began at West Point Military Academy,
where he graduated second in his class in 1829. From there, Lee rose
through the ranks of the United States Army, gaining particular notice
for his role in suppressing John Brown's 1859 uprising in Harper's
Ferry.[^1] Lee also served as superintendent of West Point from
1852--1855.[^2]

But after Virginia's secession from the Union, Lee defected from the
United States to the Confederacy, where he eventually rose to become the
supreme Southern military chief. This left a complicated legacy at West
Point: Lee was an illustrious leader known for skilled generalship, but
also a traitor who fought against the United States. Black journalists
were particularly interested in exposing West Point's efforts to
whitewash Lee's betrayal.

In 1931, the *Afro-American* published an article on the United
Daughters of the Confederacy's donation of a painting of Lee to West
Point, in which they connected the receipt of the gift to existing
patterns of racism at the institution: "There is so much of the spirit
of this rebel general and of the Confederacy in West Point," they wrote,
that Black students have a difficult time getting admitted and "find it
impossible after graduation to secure assignments with troops."[^3]

The article pointed out the absurdity of hanging a portrait of a rebel
leader at a military institution:

> Strange is it how a defiant and rebellious Dixie, beaten and surly
> still, seeks covert means of fostering its spirit and perpetuating its
> heroes. The West Point painting shows General Lee as a brevet Colonel
> of Engineers of the U.S. Army in the 50's. No hint there of the rebel
> he became; no suggestion that he was to violate his oath and use his
> West Point training in an effort to dismember the union.

The authors proposed a careful distinction that could be made to honor
Lee for his service as a US military officer who had not attained the
rank of general:

> A painting of *General* Lee in his rebel uniform could not be accepted
> by West Point. A painting of *Colonel* Lee is accepted. A statue of
> Jeff Davis, as *president* of the rebel confederacy, could not stand
> in the Capitol at Washington, but the statute of *Senator* Davis does
> stand there. So, the South, defeated, and humiliated, still grasps at
> will-o'-wisps to soothe its pride, but never gets very far.

In a 1933 article by the *Pittsburgh Courier*, the newspaper covered
another UDC-sponsored commemoration at West Point: "each year a Robert
E. Lee sword" was presented "to a West Point Military Academy
cadet."[^4] They reported the opinion of the Grand Army of the
Republic---the Union veterans' fraternal league---which condemned the
UDC's involvement. "The Civil War veterans, as their 67^th^ encampment
ended, urged the government to abolish the practice," and it was noted
that this was the first time in their history that they advocated for
such an action.[^5] The Grand Army of the Republic, it was reported,
also denounced the sale of 50-cent coins "to aid in defraying the cost
of the Stone Mountain Memorial to Confederate soldiers."[^6] The
*Afro-American* published a shortened version of the article on the same
day.[^7]
